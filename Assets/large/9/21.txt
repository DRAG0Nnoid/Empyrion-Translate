Vessels and stations that are either privately held or belong to independent companies often have running contracts with the big factions, like Zirax Empire, Kriel Empire, Traders Guild and Polaris Megacorp as well as the Colonists and DESC. Smugglers handling stuff for the Pirate Clans or everyone who can pay them, can be found as well.[]In this case, the vessels, escorting drones and stations listed below will have their faction color and tags set to the company, faction or individual they are running a business for.[]How they behave towards you is based on your reputation to the faction, company or individual they are currently working for.[]Note on escorting DRONES: Due to the fact the freighters are often hired by factions and companies, the escorting drones might be of a different kind than the drones usually used by the hiring faction/company. This depends on the expenses the owner of the freighter has made or drones that he could acquire or was given..
Pelican Class (Armored Transport).
Although it wasn't fully equipped for combat at the time of its destruction, the schematics for the TITAN ship class exist in every UCH Engineer's personal database to aid repairs to these vessels, where the UCH 003 GRANT is the last one to be known operational. []Constructed by Forge Aerospace's Anvil, the UCH 002 TITAN class ships were designated UCH fleet flagships, capable of housing almost 200 crew and multiple crafts, with advanced weaponry - compared to the technical level of the other terran vessels based in the solar system. The GRAND has been upgraded with more powerful tech found and acquired in Andromeda, though.[]Despite the size of the ship, it remains a highly maneuverable heavy cruiser with enough computing power capable to handle a much larger array of additional armaments beyond standard at designated hardpoints all over the ship.[]Attack Value: []Defense Value: []Weapon types: []Shields:[]Drones:.

1.  Action leads to reaction. Killing or looting and other actions now come at a cost or with a reward of REPUTATION POINTS[]2. NPC Factions have TERRITORIES. Performing the aforementioned Actions inside or outside the territory might show different results[]3. You can make friends, but due to the RIVALRY of faction, you might make enemies at the same time[]Technical notes:[]- The NPC Factions do not grow their territories.[]Creators info[]- It is possible to set the game-start standing vs. NPC Factions individually for the Player-Origins in the DefReputation.ecf ! This means: THAT will be the standing a player of THIS origin will start with. It does not mean that all players of this origin contribute to a common standing vs. NPC factions!.
Indestructible blocks, devices and structures.
Player Spawn / Respawn.
There are two variants:[]1. Default Core: armored blocks[]Handheld weapons often cannot damage or even destroy blocks of Capital Vessels and Bases. A notification on the top center will inform you about that.[]2. Admin Core[]Some bases, mostly POIs might use an ""admin core"". When you look at the map, this is indicated by a 'chevron' icon instead of the rounded one.[] Admin cores make all blocks and devices indestructible for any weapon EXCEPT those that have been set to be ""destroyable"" by the creator of the POI. [] There is one important premise for the default game: In case an admin-core station can shoot at you, turrets and relevant devices can always be destroyed. A station with an admin core which does NOT shoot at you (and which is NOT a Trading Station), is either a Dungeon or a Story-relevant POI.  But: Most of the time there is still a method for the core to be destroyed by the player. For example a lever or a puzzle or a riddle that will blast the core when solved. Without  a core, all the blocks and devices are destructible again!.
NPC vessels can be found on planets and in space. []- Planetary Patrol vessels are armed and armored sector patrols. []- Freighters are orbital vessels transporting goods and resources.

[]You can buy and refill fuel, ammo and pentaxid, as well as repair your ship (repair-2-template!) and quick-load your shield - in case you have the required credits on your bank account! []Creators Information: The availability of station services (and which services are offered) can be set individually for an orbital or planetary POI in the playfield_static.yaml PROPERTIES entry. The pricing is taken from a new parameter, set in the ItemsConfig.ecf. This base pricing can then be further modified by factors in the playfield_static.yaml file.[].
Attacked POIs will call for reinforcements; Reinforcements do not always appear, depending on several factors, eg. playfield level.[]A message will appear that informs you when the reinforcements will appear. In case you destroy all the reinforcements, another message will inform you about your victory![]Creators Information:[]The SBD is configured in the FactionWarfare.ecf in the /Content/Configuration game folder.[]There is also an override syntax to  manage the SBD per POI.  Add the following entry to the POI in the space_dynamic.yaml:[]SpaceDefenseOverrideDefaults: True[]SpaceDefenseProbability: 0[]SpaceDefensePriceMinMax: []Note: Only SpaceDefenseOverrideDefaults is a setting that is mandatory in case you want to handle an individual POI different than laid down in the factionwarfare config.
