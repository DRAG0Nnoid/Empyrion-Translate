[]We always assume that evolution in the universe follows the same rules, so there is a high chance that we do not see anything extraordinary when looking to the stars. Of course, the chances that we are wrong, are equally high. []Ernest Jakkard, Sc.D UCH Xenobiological Research Facility 2468 AD []--- []To show all topics of this guide, click the DROPDOWN ARROW of this chapters HEADLINE in the list on the left!

[]Your suit will automatically test and categorize any biological and non-biological item according to similarities found with earth organisms with the built-in xenobiological testing procedure. []This means: Even if an item might look different or drop from a plant that does not even remotely look earth-like, anything you can harvest from a plant will be categorized into []Nutrition Groups[] and displayed as: Plant Protein, Natural Sweetener, Grain, Berries, Fruit, Mushroom, Natural Stimulant, Vegetables, Spice, Buds.[]Medical ingredients[] are displayed as: Herbal Leaves, Confetti Moss Scrapings, Fire Moss Scrapings, Alien Tooth, Alien Parts, Alien Plasma T6, Alien Plasma ZR1, Alien Thorn[]Note: Eating ingredients or raw food has a risk of getting you an Indigestion!.
[]Sprouts are created in the food processor from an item/crop of the plant and Nutrient Solution. Example: Plant Protein + Nutrient Solution will give you an Ahax Sprout.[].
[]Oxygen: Always required []No O2 = []Plant will stop growing[]Temperature: 15-35°C | lower 0 or higher than 50 = []Plant will die[]Radiation: 0[] | RAD higher than 3 = []Plant will die[].
[]- Base / Vessel needs to be powered | No Power = []Plant will stop growing[]- Inside a base or Vessel you need a GROWING LIGHT. Place it on the ceiling with exactly 2 blocks in between the top side of the growing plot and the ceiling where the Growing Light is placed []- A growing light can support 3x3 growing plots at max when placed at the ceiling in the center spot of this array. []- If the outside conditions meet the Growing Conditions, you can set up a farm without a growing light on the outside. In this case OUTSIDE = open to the sky with no roof (includes NO windows).
[]For most of the items, protocols allow to []alternatively craft them from different ingredients[] as well. []For example: Milk, Meat, Plant Protein and most of the Medical ingredients like Scrapings, Alien Parts and Plasma can be converted from substitutes![].

1. All the faction-assignments below apply to wandering NPCs and Patrols at all times (does NOT depend on the faction territory!) []2. If an NPC is spawned in a POI, the origin of the NPC is defined by the faction of the POI, EXCEPT the creator of the POI has set a different origin for the to-be-spawned NPC (what is possible in the NPC Spawn setup dialogue!) []3. Turret targeting info, regarding NPC factions: []- All NPC factions members ( Zrx, Pol, Tal) apply to the 'NPC Factions' checkbox, either in a POI or when wandering around! []- Turrets will not attack Zrx, Pol and Tal if you are on NEUTRAL standing or better, even WHEN the checkbox for NPC factions is ticked! []- LEGACY (Global 'Alien' Faction) creatures will be attacked only when PREDATOR checkbox is ticked, as Aln is not a real NPC faction (you cannot change your standing; always HOSTILE) []- Prey and Predator are no NPC factions. That's why they have their own targeting setting..
