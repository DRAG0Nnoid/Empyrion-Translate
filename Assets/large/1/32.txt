[ IDA, is the Operation Phoenix preparation on track and meeting its targeted timelines? [ Yes, all vessels will be ready for departure as planned. [ Any new information from the listening posts? [ No Sir. The tracking of the 'Event' has not shown any deviation from the predicted timing. [ Sir? Are there any problems? [ No IDA. Everything is fine. Just thinking about the consequences. [ Do you wish to proceed? [ We have no other choice, IDA. [ That's correct, Sir. [ Ok, IDA. Time has come. [ I know, Sir. I am quite .. excited? [ Good to know, IDA.

[ One last thing to do... [ IDA, please send the wave rider protocol. Code: Black-Wave-Black. [ Wave rider protocol has been sent. [... Orders have been issued to all vessels and stations. [... Override codes have been accepted. [ Thanks IDA. Let's hope, the council's trust in Commander Lamarr and Commander {PlayerName} is justified. For whatever reason they have been chosen by the council - without telling them. Godspeed, to both of you. The fate of two galaxies seems to be in your hands from now on. [ IDA, it's about time. Please start the countdown. [ Wave rider protocol has been activated. Countdown started. Time left until the 'Event' .. 23h 32m 15s [ Sir, I wish you all the best. [ Thanks, IDA.

[Command Meeting Room [T minus 23:02:13 [Admiral Yaden [Vice Admiral Benner [Commander Mercer [===[ Hello, Mr. Mercer. The Council is sending you over for another last minute stress test? [ Admiral. Vice Admiral. [ Please have a seat, Mercer. [ Thanks, Vice Admiral. [ So..? Why are we meeting here? Has the start been postponed again? [ No Sirs. The opposite has happened. The scheduled start has been set to 1600. Tomorrow. [ What? Mercer! Can you please tell the Council, that this is at least 24h too early? The warp drives are not ready. Not to mention all the other stuff that is missing... [ I am afraid, the countdown has already started. The other commanders will be informed in an hour about the new schedule. I checked the status of all ships. We should be ready, even for this accelerated schedule. [ I just checked the new mission parameters. All shore leaves have been canceled. The personnel on Apollon station, Titan station and the marine bases will be sent to the transports in the next 12h. Seems there is no way back, hmm? [ No. The time window of the 'Event' is set and will be open only for a minute, perhaps less. [ Ok. Then, so be it. We knew this could happen. [ Mr. Benner, please commence the start protocols. [ Aye, Sir. [ Mr. Mercer, we have installed the control station you requested. It is locked with your credentials. [ Thanks, Sir. [ THEIA! Condition yellow at 10 00 tomorrow morning. [ Affirmative, Sir. [ Ok, gentlemen, let's add a new chapter to mankind's history!.
[Mission Planning Room [T minus 8:02:13 [Lt. Commander Lamarr [Lt. Commander Zerogen [===[ Jennifer, did your team already set up the reworked warp cage for the new schedule? These guys are crazy. Rescheduling the start to 24h earlier...[ They literally threw me out of my bed in the middle of the night. But yes, we managed to get this done just a few minutes before your arrival. [ Hey, ... before I forget, there is a new guy on the bridge ... Mencer? Mirse? Mercer? not exactly sure. Black suit. Spooky guy. [ Hmm ... I sense some trouble, but no real surprise. The whole project has gone a strange route. Don't you think? [ Do you remember when we were college students? When the first team started after the Hyperion was lost? Analyze the incident. Build a new science vessel. We can do it better.. blah blah blah ... all those pathetic speeches? [ Yes. We had a test about the Hyperion Incident and what followed from it in our science class in college. If I would have known that, after I signed up 5 years ago, that they are building a fleet.. With only two functional warp drives! I would have taken it for an April Fool's joke. [ Absolutely. And.. why do we need those turrets and even combat ships? And Marines? And fighters? All docked in two clusters around the two ships going to Proxima Centauri for a warp drive test and resource gathering? [ Feels like the Admirals want to invade a solar system. Like in the old star combat movies we watched last week. [ OK, I'd better get some sleep. Being prepared is everything. 'May the thought be with you.' [ Haha.. Send your colleagues to the cabins as well. You and your team have achieved something next to impossible in the given timeframe. I'll check the settings with the AI in the next few hours. Good night! [ Good night. See you later on the bridge. [ THEIA! Can you please try to sync the incoming waves with the modules to 0.2? We should try to minimize any signal loop, or any external disturbance will make this whole thing either a giant heater ... or an uncontrollable wave skimmer. [ Of course, Commander. Adjustments are in the works.
