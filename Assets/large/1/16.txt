A baby moon, with a not yet solid core, and faint traces of an atmosphere. Maybe it was born out of a stellar disc, or it is the remnant of a spectacular planetary collision.[Possible resources: [  Iron, Silicon, Cobalt, Magnesium, Promethium, Pentaxid[Possible weather effects: [n/a.

A world in its youth: The atmosphere has cooled enough for it to rain. Last bits of the planetary neighbourhood crash into the surface, and violent jetstreams produce hail.

A B-type main-sequence star (B V) is a main-sequence (hydrogen-burning) star of spectral type B and luminosity class V.

F-type stars have strengthening spectral lines H and K of Ca II. Neutral metals (Fe I, Cr I) beginning to gain on ionized metal lines by late F.

G-type stars, including the Sun, have prominent spectral lines H and K of Ca II, which are most pronounced at G2.

Class M stars are by far the most common. About 76% of the main-sequence stars in the solar neighborhood are class M stars. However, class M main-sequence stars (red dwarfs) have such low luminosities that none are bright enough to be seen with the unaided eye, unless under exceptional conditions.

A neutron star is the collapsed core of a giant star which before collapse had a total mass of between 10 and 29 solar masses. Neutron stars are the smallest and densest stars, excluding black holes, hypothetical white holes, quark stars and strange stars. Neutron stars have a radius on the order of 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) and a mass of about 1.4 solar masses. They result from the supernova explosion of a massive star, combined with gravitational collapse, that compresses the core past white dwarf star density to that of atomic nuclei.[Spectral Class: N[Type: Neutron Star[Galaxy Probability: 0.00625 [Size Class: 7[Surface Temperature: 10000000 - 100000000 K[Mass: 2x solar sun masses  [Radius: 0.00004x solar sun radii[Luminosity: n/a[Lifespan: 400 billion years  [Habitable zone:  109 - 144 AU[Note: Currently it is not possible to fly into the atmosphere of any sun-type or other celestial bodies.[
