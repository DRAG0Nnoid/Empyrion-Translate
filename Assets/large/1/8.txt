Vessel - Part I.
No O2 in Cockpit.
[]Q: I am dying from a lack of O2 while sitting in a cockpit![]You need to add an O2 tank, filled with O2 bottles to your vessel. Otherwise you'll use up your suit O2.

You will NOT die from a lack of O2 if your vessel is in an O2-rich environment (oxygenized Hangar or Planet).
CV turns only very slowly.
[]Q: My Capital Vessel turns very slow and I hate dragging the mouse for hours?[]Either add more RCS or use the ARROW KEYS for turning your Capital Vessel! Combine both and steering a large Capital Vessel will become much easier!.
[]Q: Can I add more than one cockpit to my vessel?[]Of course! But remember: []- The player that enters any cockpit AT FIRST will be the pilot of the ship. []- If this cockpit is 90° or 180° to your mounted weapons, this pilot will not have the mounted weapons on this toolbelt/at his disposal. []- Only players that sit in a cockpit parallel to the alignment of any mounted weapon can use them..
Vessel - Part II.
[]Q: Can I dock a Small Vessel or a Hover Vessel to a Capital Vessel?[]Yes, but the to-be-docked vessels need to be in the same faction as the Capital Vessel you want to dock it to. Exception: if the Capital Vessel is set to public, any private vessel can dock.[]Q: How does docking work in particular?[]Your Vessel needs to be equipped with docking pads or landing gears attached BELOW the vessel corpus. Adding docking pads on the sides or on the top will not dock the vessel to the Capital Vessel! []Move your Small Vessel or Hover Vessel onto the Capital Vessel. Lower the vessel with C and the Vessel will dock itself. There is no Docking-Key. Just have a look at the info screen on the right. It will show you a 'docked: ' with YES or NO. To undock, just hit SPACE and fly away..

[]- Other Factions = anyone that does not belong to YOUR faction (Private is also a faction!) []- Alien = Alien Drones, Soldiers and Crawlers[]- Predator = Fauna that will attack you without being provoked (like Wood Walkers or Plant Monsters). Also includes the Talon on Akua (despite that they do not attack when not provoked)[]- Prey = Fauna that will not attack you (unless being provoked).[]Q: Can I apply the targeting settings to a turret group?[]A: Yes. In the device list, group the turrets, then click on the header of the group. On the right side you will get all the targeting settings. Set the checkboxes and use APPLY to group.[]A: Orange checkbox = not all of the turrets in the group share the same setting on this targeting option..
[]Q: How does the Player Drone work (F5)?[]The drone is a building helper. It can use all building features including placing blueprints and using the Remove & Repair tool. It cannot use ALL tools or weapons yet. []Hit F5 to spawn the Player drone. It does not cost you resources or energy to do so, but it has a limited range. If you keep going farther away, the view will get distorted and finally be cut off. Your drone is lost. You can recall it using F5. []If the drone is destroyed by other players or just lost, you will not lose its inventory, as the inventory or blocks in the toolbelt are technically still in your players inventory/toolbelt..
