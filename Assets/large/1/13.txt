United Council of Humanity (UCH ).
Galactic Liberation and Defense (GLD).
Summary[The UCH was founded as a NGO back in the early 22nd century to research the predicted collapse of the Terran ecosystem. By the end of the 24th century, after the wars and catastrophic events leading into the 'dark 23th century' calmed down more and more, the UCH was re-founded as kind of a worldwide government by the surviving nations and local governments. Power was granted to the UCH authority to take care of the survival of the Terran civilization.[History[With the discovery of the alien ship in 2402 AD, the dark era for mankind ended all of a sudden. The UCH, founded nearly a century before, was able to use the find and retrieve most of the technological knowledge buried in the ice of Antarctica. This phase did not last very long as this new technology required some materials that were not obtainable in earth's solar system, but in the nearby Proxima Centauri system. Operation Phoenix, which was Earth’s last ditch effort to save itself from falling back in the dark age, was spearheaded by its flagship, the TITAN. The voyage was troubled by an unknown energetic effect, leading to the arrival in Andromeda, instead of the targeted Proxima Centauri. UCH vessels made first contact with a species known as the Zirax. Outgunned and caught off guard by the enemy, losses were abundant in the initial contact with this new species. Ships, crew members and materials were lost in an instant and Earth’s flagship the TITAN was destroyed and nearly all of the UCH’s leading officers were killed. The remaining ships, including the 2nd command ship GRAND, managed to retreat from the battle. They were able to hide in deep space, out of range of the Zirax Empire.  [Scientists are still gathering data and examining whether the term 'Empyrion' used loosely throughout history is a physical location or a spiritual/philosophical belief..
Summary[The Galactic Liberation and Defense group has strong relationships to the UCH. It is said that some of the personnel of the former Operation Phoenix fleet have joined their ranks. The purpose of the group is to support the Talon against the Zirax oppression. There are more but yet revealed reasons for this group to exist, though.
