Defeat an alien faction base by destroying the core! Notice: You must use projectile weapons to destroy its core - you cannot use explosives (e.g. rocket launcher, explosive device, etc).
Preparing an Assault means preparing the Basics. And the Basics are run by ores. Prepare your team and let's go!.
Mine 1000 Promethium Ore. Buying from a marketplace or just having it in your inventory does not complete this Mission!.
Mine 1000 Magnesium Ore. Buying from a marketplace or just having it in your inventory does not complete this Mission!.
Mine 1000 Cobalt Ore. Buying from a marketplace or just having it in your inventory does not complete this Mission!.
Mine 500 Sathium Ore. Buying from a marketplace or just having it in your inventory does not complete this Mission!.
Mine Neodymium Ore. Buying from a marketplace or just having it in your inventory does not complete this Mission!.
Your team's battleships will need a lot of fuel for flying around and maybe a few Pentaxid warp crystals for traveling to other planets. Now it is the time to refuel and restock!.
Craft 1000 Large Fuel Packs.
Craft 1000 Large Fuel Packs. You'll need to mine or acquire 2500 Promethium Ore..
Craft 100 Pentaxid. You'll need to mine or acquire 100 Pentaxid (raw material)..
Prepare for Battle MEDICAL.
Get prepared for Bullets and Bites! Your team should always carry a few essential medics for use in bad situations in their backpacks..
For more Info about Status Effects, diseases and how to cure them, please read the DOCTOR'S JOURNAL in the Empyriopedia (F1).
Prepare for Battle LIFE SUPPORT.

Is your Group well prepared? Then go ahead and raid some well defended Bases of the Alien factions! Can you keep up with them?.
The TITAN wreckage is located on the SNOW planet in the starter system. [You need a WARP-capable vessel (Small Vessel + Warpdrive + Pentaxid Tank + Pentaxid fuel).[Your vessel should have weapons and turrets..
It seems the Titan has broken into several parts....
Approach the COM ARRAY. Make sure to clear the area before going inside..
[ Get us close to a [station console[ so I can have a look in their database..
Go inside and approach the marked console..
Find the core room..
There is another teleporter in this station. You need to find it. Look for a GREEN room and signs that indicate authorized access only..

IDA? Any scanning results?.
I am afraid we can't expect the Zirax to have left anything for us to find..

Find which code? Console? Where?.
... finding a [code[ in a [maintenance console[ in a wreckage, after more than a year of the enemy tearing it apart ....
This whole expedition is absolutely doomed ....
Find the maintenance console (colored yellow/orange) in the center of the front part of the TITAN wreckage![Note: You can re-read the logs by facing the maintenance console and pressing F AND in the Empyriopedia/Journeybook!.
There are two token consoles in each wreckage. The position is marked on your hud. [Go closer to 2m to proceed with the mission.[Note: You can re-read the logs by facing the maintenance console and pressing F AND in the Empyriopedia/Journeybook!.
The command console is marked on our hud.[Note: You can re-read the logs by facing the maintenance console and pressing F AND in the Empyriopedia/Journeybook!.
So, of course these codes are distributed over the Titan. [One in each wreckage[ no doubt..
Go up to the bridge..
The teleporter is located up the elevator. Use it to proceed with the mission..
[  You need to find the [core room[. Any info should be stored there!.
