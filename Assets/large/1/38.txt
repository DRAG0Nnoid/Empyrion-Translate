Any structure or POI (point of interest) you have captured can be rebuilt and upgraded to your needs - in case you do not want to start from scratch.[In general there are several ways to build a base or a vessel.[1. Craft a [STARTER BLOCK[ for either structure type and build from the ground up, block by block.[2. Find a damaged vessel or base, put your own core and repair it up to a usable point.[3. Use the [BLUEPRINT LIBRARY & FACTORY[ ([F2[) to print a prefab.  [About using the BP LIBRARY AND FACTORY:[1. Open the [BLUEPRINT LIBRARY[ by pressing [F2.[2. Select the [STOCK [icon on the top left filter icons group.[3. Select the prefab blueprint that fits your needs[4. Click on it and select [TO FACTORY [and the view will switch to the factory view.[5. In the Factory, add all the required materials to the intake and hit START PRODUCTION.[6. Wait until the product is ready ( a message will pop up on the top right! )[7. Open the BLUEPRINT LIBRARY: You will find the finished base or vessel at the top of the list[8. Select it and spawn it.[When spawning, use [PAGE UP / PAGE DOWN[, [HOME / END[ and [INSERT / DELETE[ buttons to adjust the spawning position of the vessel[Knowledge:[- You can not only add ingots, but also devices and blocks that are using these ingots in their template[- You can add items and devices from your CONNECTED TOOLBAR as well![- Adding devices instead of ingots will CUT DOWN the production time![.

[ Commander, the explosion might have weakened some of the plates on the walls in the entry room. [Check them for cracks..
For all the devices we need to craft in order to make the Com Station a real base, we need to find a valuable source of resources: [underground deposits[That's how you spot those deposits in case you did not yet detect them:[- Walk around with your Survival Tool or Drill in your hand OR use your Detector to find a [Iron, Copper[ or [Silicon[ deposit nearby.[- In case you only get a [< Resource >[ marker instead of the resource type being revealed, go closer than 300m and scan again OR point at the marker with the Survival Tool or a Drill in your hand.[Go to any deposit.[.

Head back to the base and put all materials into the [Portable Constructor[You might also need additional materials such as Fiber and Crushed Stone..
In case you do not spawn a base or vessel from the Blueprint Library/Factory ([F2[), the Portable Constructor is the basic device you need in order to be able to upgrade your base to a more functional emplacement..
In addition to a [Core[, a [Generator [and a [Fuel Tank[, which are the required devices to run a base or vessel at all, there are several other basic devices that will improve the viability of your emplacement, opening up more possibilities, improved shelter and defense capabilities.[Craft a [Small Constructor[ and a [Cargo Box[, equip them to your [toolbar [and [place them onto the base[You might need to unlock them from the Techtree ([F3[) at first.[Tip: you can either enlarge the base plate (craft and place Wood, Carbon or Steel Blocks and place them) OR you can use the Build Helper ""Connect to base"" ([) to place the devices anywhere on the ground..
The Small Constructor is the most important basic base device..
You do not only need containers for storage BUT they are also required for the Constructors to work!.

A plant grow light can be used indoors but also outside, though on temperate planets you can grow your crops without a grow light if the conditions are good.  Check the Empyriopedia ([F1[) for more info about farming!.
