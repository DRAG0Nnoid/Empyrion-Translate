[Warp Core Control Room [T minus 5:02:13 [Commander Lamarr [Commander Mercer [===[ Hello, Commander Lamarr! [ Oh, hello Commander Mercer. Nice to have you here. I've heard you are now responsible for the warp engines and the protocols. And for having overwritten my repair protocols and tests the moment you stepped on board the TITAN? [ So, how can I help you? [ I am just having a look at the warp core. Impressive! [ Yes. Unbelievable what the techs have pulled out of that pile of junk in Antarctica four decades ago. Nothing but destroyed devices and incomplete blueprints but now, somehow it just magically works. Ok, well, not magically, you know what I mean. [ Yes, indeed. [ Just a question, if you don't mind? These black suits ... is this kind of an uniform? [ That's confidential. [ Oh. Ok. So, what exactly are you doing here? [ As I said, having a look at the warp core and its optimizations. [ Hmm. Ok. Then enjoy your stay. I am setting up the final routines. Or do you want to rewrite them right away? [ No worries. [ It seems there have been no issues with the schedule being moved forward, yes? [ Er, ahem, No. Sure. The teams have made exceptional progress since some office-sitter decided to throw them out of their beds. This, after already working weeks with nearly no sleep. [ That's obviously the risk of working in the expedition fleet, right? [ Ha ha. Tell you what, this whole 'expedition' thing is going a strange route. Not to mention, there's a Council that governs all the decisions and the UCH is somehow in the dark. Don't you think this requires some additional ... explanation? [ No. What should we explain? To whom? There is nothing secret about the expedition, for those that are involved. We'll tell the people what they need to know. [ Yes. That's exactly my point! As you might know, my grandpa was the lead engineer on the Hyperion. He was not lost with the ship only for one simple reason: someone decided to reschedule his shift. I'm thankful for that, but my grandpa never managed to get rid of the stigma of 'the coward that was left behind'. [ My dad moved to Mars with me after my grandpa's sudden death. I signed up for the fleet right after college, to show what our family is capable of. My dad said that Grandpa became crazy about this shit. Pretending the officials just want to silence everyone. Especially him personally, and the Hyperion Bereaved organization. All his stories of a 'planned accident.' The ship 'not being destroyed' and some 'threat' we are facing - all very dramatic. [ And, to be honest, until the last 24h, I always thought this old poor man simply could not cope with what happened. When you showed up on board the Titan, I suddenly remembered one of my grandpa's stories, about some 'black suits' visiting the Hyperion a few days ahead of the mission. [ Commander. Please... [ No! Listen, Mercer. I've been working for this project for nearly eight years now, and in these last few months, I've looked at this project and I've done the math. In the last week, and in the last 24 h in particular, so many strange things have happened. [ Did you know the GRAND and the TITAN each have several squads of marines on board? Sure you do. I checked the manifests yesterday. We have stashed away tons and tons and tons of high caliber ammo. I am an engineer. I know what these formulas and materials are made for. This is not for asteroid defense. So don't tell me this 'nothing is secret' bullshit. And now you are coming on board. And the first thing you do, is to mess around with the protocols I have been developing for the last five years. [ Commander. Calm down please. The adjustments we've made have been derived from important data, coming directly from Apollon labs. Dr Greyson and Dr. Dawson? You might know them. [ I do. But I have also looked at the changes you made. These are risky. I am not sure what they should do exactly. They don't seem to have any function that improves the efficiency of the warp drives. [ Rest assured, these have been approved by top specialists, everything is fine. [ Rest assured, that if something goes wrong .. and someone is harmed .. and I discover that it was because of your changes .. nothing will be fine ... for you..
[Captains Room [T minus 2:02:13 [Captain Benner [Commander Mercer [Ensign Adams [===[ Sir, we are picking up strange signals from Apollon Station. The station AI is also not responding to our calls! [ Any additional Information? [ No sir. No contact possible. [ Thanks, Adams. [ THEIA! Set alert condition Orange. [ Ensign! Please return to your station! [ THEIA! Status of the fleet? [ All vessels are ready for departure. 99% of personnel boarded [ 99% ? [ The transports from Apollon Station have not yet arrived. Specifically, Dr. Greyson, Dr. Dawson and Commander Henricks have not yet arrived, in addition to others. [ I have no contact with any of them. DAVE is no longer responding. [ Mercer? [ No contact. We must wait, as the schedule demands. [ This is risky, you know? [ Yes, I know exactly what you mean..
[Bridge [T minus 0:2:00 [Captain Benner, Commander Mercer, Commander Lamarr [Lt. Commander Zerogen, Lt. Senner [Ensign Yasir, Ensign Adams [===[ Yasir! Any news from Apollon station? [ Sir, Apollon Station has vanished from our screens a few seconds ago! [ I'm afraid the scans indicate a giant explosion. [ NO! That.. [ Emergency protocol! Immediately send rescue units. [ I am afraid we cannot send any craft. All vessels are currently in their final docking positions. Undocking would require more than an hour. [ Sir! A transport is approaching us. Survivors of Apollon Station! [ Lamarr.. ehm .. check the transport for any anomalies. Docking procedure, please. [ Captain! There is something going on with the TITAN! And the GRAND! The warp drives are coming online! The warp protocol has been started and .. [ Mercer! Stop this! That is not going to happen! [ I am afraid Sir, this cannot be stopped. The countdown has ended. The Waverider protocol has taken over control. [ I knew it! [ You owe me some explanations, Mister Mercer! THEIA! Set alert condition Red! [ Lamarr! What about the transporters? [ Sir! The transports are docked. Neither of the missing bridge crew is on board. Dawson. Greyson. Henricks. [ This .. [ All personnel! Warp jump imminent. T minus one minute. [ Captain! I am tracking a fast ship approaching us. ETA 50 seconds. [ Sir! Several gravity anomalies generate around the fleet! They look like giant.. holes in the fabric of spacetime.. I cannot describe it.. [ The energy wavefront is interacting with the warp fields! [ The 'Event' .. [ The.. what? THEIA! Start compensating procedure! [ I am afraid Commander, the procedure is not available. [ THEIA! Emergency abort! Override Permission Captain Alpha Purple! [ I am afraid, Vice Admiral, aborting the sequence is not possible. Override not possible below level Black. [ What is this...? Someone get the Admiral on the bridge! ASAP! [ Sir! The pilot of the shuttle is contacting us! It is Henricks! [ Lamarr speaking! Henricks! Get in here! We... [ Warpdrive Countdown sequence started. [ Quick..! [ 10 [ Henricks! Get your back on board! Damn! [ The comm seems to be blocked by the interferences. [ 9 [ Jennifer! What will happen if the shuttle is caught in the warp field close to the TITAN? [ 8 [ There is a chance that it will be dragged to our destination ... or shredded to pieces! [ 7 [ Er, ahem .. The gravitation seems to have synced with the warp field! This is ... [ ... impossible! The drive is not built to ... [ 5 [ Who knows! This all started when that guy came on board, the council suit!

[July 26, 2473 [Arrival in unknown system[Admiral Benner [Commander Mercer [===[ Sir! We can't wait any longer. The unknown enemy is amassing more and more ships. We've already lost two transports and the TITAN will not stand a chance. Please, get to the shuttle! [ Mercer, this is not your command. Get out of here and take Yaden with you. We still must investigate the anomaly we found when entering this system. I will report to Admiral Perez on the GRAND. [ How shall we..? [< loud explosion > [< log damaged > [ This is Vide Admiral Benner! All personnel, abandon ship! I repeat. ABANDON SHIP! The TITAN is lost! All personnel go to the rescue pods!

This whole operation seems to have had totally different goals than the ones the teams were told. This should have been a short trip to Proxima Centauri to get more Pentaxid to help Earth survive. [But we ended up billions of light years beyond that point! In Andromeda![The fleet left the Jupiter orbit - forced by the Waverider Protocol as it seems. The irregular warp vortex we were dragged into might be the reason for the passage to Andromeda. A wavefront, which pushed us further than the warp drives could ever have achieved alone. It seems like this was not an accident, but finely planned to the minute. [I'm also not sure our little one-year delay was an accident either, ... planned as well, or a random side-effect?[The fleet was attacked immediately upon arrival here ... which makes me think those Zirax were waiting for them @w4 for some reason..
