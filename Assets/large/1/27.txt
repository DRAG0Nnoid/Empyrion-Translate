On the planetary and orbital map, you can also set other markers that can be used as bookmarks.[Left-Click on a position will bring up a menu.

[This applies to Orbital Patrol Vessels (OPVs) spawned by the Space Base Defense (SBD) reinforcements mechanism as soon as a POI calls for help.[Q: What do I need to do to stop the vessel?[A: Destroy the Thrusters[Q: Will this set off an automated despawn timer?[A: Depends. There are a few options.[- If the ship can still move, but only has lost a lot of weapons, it will try to warp out (if it has a warp drive)[- If the ship is not able to move and lost all weapons it will start the self destruction[- If the vessel is not able to move, but still has some weapons, it will remain a wreck until s.o. removes the core or with playfield-clear up despawn.[Q: Can I board and loot (the containers of) the vessel?[A: Yes.[Q: Can I salvage/multitool the vessel when I stopped it?[A: No, because for salvaging (removing parts with the Multitool) you need to de-core it, which will set off the destruction sequence and despawn the vessel, which works as follows: Core removed > 30 Second silent countdown until explosion sequence > after another 60 seconds, the ship will despawn.[Q: Can I control / capture the vessel[A: Currently not.[Q: Is there a way to modify the parameters like despawn, respawn etc?[A: No. There are settings for the SBD available in ..\Empyrion - Galactic Survival\Content\Configuration\FactionWarfare.ecf  BUT you cannot deactivate the de-coring destruction sequence.
