Summary[]The UCH was founded as a NGO back in the early 22nd century to research the predicted collapse of the Terran ecosystem. By the end of the 24th century, after the wars and catastrophic events leading into the 'dark 23th century' calmed down more and more, the UCH was re-founded as kind of a worldwide government by the surviving nations and local governments. Power was granted to the UCH authority to take care of the survival of the Terran civilization.[]History[]With the discovery of the alien ship in 2402 AD, the dark era for mankind ended all of a sudden. The UCH, founded nearly a century before, was able to use the find and retrieve most of the technological knowledge buried in the ice of Antarctica. This phase did not last very long as this new technology required some materials that were not obtainable in earth's solar system, but in the nearby Proxima Centauri system. Operation Phoenix, which was Earth’s last ditch effort to save itself from falling back in the dark age, was spearheaded by its flagship, the TITAN. The voyage was troubled by an unknown energetic effect, leading to the arrival in Andromeda, instead of the targeted Proxima Centauri. UCH vessels made first contact with a species known as the Zirax. Outgunned and caught off guard by the enemy, losses were abundant in the initial contact with this new species. Ships, crew members and materials were lost in an instant and Earth’s flagship the TITAN was destroyed and nearly all of the UCH’s leading officers were killed. The remaining ships, including the 2nd command ship GRAND, managed to retreat from the battle. They were able to hide in deep space, out of range of the Zirax Empire.  []Scientists are still gathering data and examining whether the term 'Empyrion' used loosely throughout history is a physical location or a spiritual/philosophical belief..
Summary[]The Galactic Liberation and Defense group has strong relationships to the UCH. It is said that some of the personnel of the former Operation Phoenix fleet have joined their ranks. The purpose of the group is to support the Talon against the Zirax oppression. There are more but yet revealed reasons for this group to exist, though..
[]The Ziraxian Empire is a militarist oligarchy and the largest power in the galaxy Andromeda. It is ruled by a series of houses, each with a specific function or functions that relates to a sphere of influence. These houses each produce a representative at an, as yet, undiscovered time, and they form a council of elders. This production is facilitated by the Empress who publicly holds supreme power, but is possibly more a figure head.[]Expand folder to read more[].
[]The Talon are an astonishingly primitive society with little variation. They seem to have []abandoned all technological advancements - for some unknown reason.[] The Zirax impose a heavy toll upon the Talon  – zealously sheltering them with drones and other restraints. This may indicate either the Talon pose a threat to them… or are kept hostages for some unknown reason.[].

Water is quite common in the universe, as life-enabling liquid, or at least as ice or vapor. However, not every planet is gifted with water. Some worlds get scorched by their home star, or maybe their magnetic field is too weak to stem against the push of the stellar wind. But even this place of glaring sunshine has managed to keep some spots here or there...[]Possible resources:[]  Iron, Cobalt, Copper, Titanium, Neodymium, Promethium[]Possible weather effects:[]  Heat Wave[]Planet type data and possible variations:[]  Life-bearing[]  Atmosphere breathable: []Not always (30% chance)[]  Atmospheric O2 fraction: 10 - 20%[]  Atmospheric density: 0.6 - 1.0 kg/m³[]  Day temperature: 10 to 65°C[]  Night temperature: -45 to 20°C[]  Low chance of water[]  Radiation: 0 - 5 Gy/d[]  Gravity: 0.8 - 1.0 g.

Planets are born by the swirling, scattered ashes - the legacy of dead, exploded stars. Gravity will collect all this messy debris, and give it a new form. But a world's amount of rock and dust, slowly grinding, clumping together... will result in an enormous amount of friction. Which means, []heat[]This place is just a mere quarter billion years old, and struggles to radiate all this excess heat into space - The bigger the planet, the longer it takes.[]In this liquid state, the planet resembles more a giant cooking pot, or lava lamp, or a blast furnace:Continents of less dense slag skim the surface, while the heavy, exotic metals sink into in planet's deep inner.[]Yet, by thermal churning and stirring, some bits of that precious core will be again swept back out, in reach of the surface. For those who brave these temperatures, there will be great rewards.[]Possible resources:[]  Magnesium, Erestrum, Promethium, Zascosium, Gold[]Possible weather effects:[]  Heat Wave, Meteor Rain, Fire Rain, Meteor Shower, Thunderstorm[]Planet type data and possible variations:[]  Traces of aggressive fauna detected.
