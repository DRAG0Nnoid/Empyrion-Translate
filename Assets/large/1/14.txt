[The Ziraxian Empire is a militarist oligarchy and the largest power in the galaxy Andromeda. It is ruled by a series of houses, each with a specific function or functions that relates to a sphere of influence. These houses each produce a representative at an, as yet, undiscovered time, and they form a council of elders. This production is facilitated by the Empress who publicly holds supreme power, but is possibly more a figure head.[Expand folder to read more[.
[The Talon are an astonishingly primitive society with little variation. They seem to have [abandoned all technological advancements - for some unknown reason.[ The Zirax impose a heavy toll upon the Talon  – zealously sheltering them with drones and other restraints. This may indicate either the Talon pose a threat to them… or are kept hostages for some unknown reason.[.

Planets are born by the swirling, scattered ashes - the legacy of dead, exploded stars. Gravity will collect all this messy debris, and give it a new form. But a world's amount of rock and dust, slowly grinding, clumping together... will result in an enormous amount of friction. Which means, [heat[This place is just a mere quarter billion years old, and struggles to radiate all this excess heat into space - The bigger the planet, the longer it takes.[In this liquid state, the planet resembles more a giant cooking pot, or lava lamp, or a blast furnace:Continents of less dense slag skim the surface, while the heavy, exotic metals sink into in planet's deep inner.[Yet, by thermal churning and stirring, some bits of that precious core will be again swept back out, in reach of the surface.

Travel serves more than war, trade and leisure. Because the more isolated a place is -  more the sooner than the later a humble life reaches that shore, settles down, and gets a chance to rock the old dominion: Plant seeds as stowaways in the chinks of jackboots, the creatures of the ducts of container shuttles, or introduced as companions, or to hunt.
