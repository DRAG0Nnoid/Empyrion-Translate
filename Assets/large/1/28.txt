[Dr. Greyson[Dr. Dawson [Security Chief/Commander [==[< Lab Access requested. Code BRAVO > [ There you are! What took you so long? [ Hey Doc! Seems like the internal com has some issues .. again. I just got your assignment note only a few minutes ago. Someone will have to look into this mess tomorrow whe... [ Sure, sure. Now - let's get started one something important. Timing is key. [ The tech team has installed the new transceiver that will allow us to track a cosmological event, which happens only every dozen years. We want to pick up that signal and investigate the results, so the fleet can probably make use of the data. Let me quickly check the status. DAVE? [ Processing requests, doctor. [< Code Access. BLACK > [ < Door opening > [ Doc! The wave array is read .. oh, hi Chief.. eh Commander, Sir! Coming over to help us? [ Seems so. Something you guys broke .. let me guess .. maybe cake in the sequencer again? [< two persons laughing > [ Ok. Meet you later over at the TITAN! [< Door opening > [< Lab Access module request. Code BLACK >[ Dr. Greyson? The data has been sent to your terminal. [ Thanks DAVE. Turns out, your access permission is required to complete the installation, Commander. And, while you're at it, lend these guys a hand since you know best how to work on that system. Tech Chief Kuehn is down in the engine section. [ Ok Doc, no worries. We'll get this transceiver online in no time..
[Tech Chief Kuehn [Security Chief/Commander [==[< loud voices > [< metallic noises > [ Commander, I told you several times that it will not work that way![ Hey, at least we had to try it! It seems this whole installation is flawed. This is like trying to put a B-connector into an A-plug. DAVE, whose idea was this, anyway?[ Greyson said we have to install this .. and time is running out, she said. Whatever this means. Probably because our shift is over in an hour! [< several persons laughing > [ Ok, new idea - you will stay here on the console and I will go down to the control core and reboot the whole thing. If that doesn't work... [ It better should! Ok, I will tell Dawson to check the power level..

It holds a new type of energy-based survival multitool. Switch to DMG mode to use its beam for attack and defense. [ Wait.. what? [ Check your com please. We have some strange alerts piling up.

[< weapon fire >[< biological noises > [< weapon fire > [< Access module M1 destroyed >[ Commander, we are about to lose the station to the intruders. [  Genius! As if I wouldn't have noticed that! That's why we brought all the staff to the shuttles, right? Now I'm the only one sitting here cut off from the transport! [ There is a scout ship docked on the hull outside Hangar B. You can use that .. in case you manage to first get on the other side of the B hangar door. [< biological noises >[< weapon fire >[< Air Duct sec 01 unlocked >[ Use the air duct on your right.

The Operation Phoenix Fleet dropped out of hyperspace in an unknown solar system on July 26, 2473, and was immediately attacked by Zirax forces. The transporter UCH Heidelberg was shot down, but there were several survivors. A few of them left messages for the player to find in certain places. Those messages should give him a first idea about what happened to the fleet and where to start searching for survivors.[While examining the crashed vessel, you find indications that you did not arrive WITH the fleet, but lost 1 year for some unknown warp-drive-jump-gone-wrong reasons while you were dragged into the warp-vortex of the TITAN and the Operation Phoenix fleet. [You are actually in the year 2474.[This chapters logs and messages are setting up the basic storyline for all UCH-related missions.[.
The TITAN - Background Info.
The TITAN has been the flagship of the Operation Phoenix Fleet. Together with its sister ship, the UCH GRAND, it led the voyage into the unknown. Instead of arriving in Proxima Centauri (Milkyway) the fleet was dragged to Andromeda, caused by the Waverider Protocol initiating an irregular warp jump. After their arrival, the TITAN was destroyed in the initial battle that followed when the fleet left hyperspace. Its remains are to be found on the Moon of the starter system.[The TITAN wreckage on the moon had several messages secretly saved for you to be found later. Why Commander Mercer (Senior) did this, is not clear, but the logs shed light on the events that lead to the alleged failure of Operation Phoenix up to the point where the player was dragged into the warp vortex of the TITAN..
You are making your first contact with the GLaD organization. Your first mission: search for a lost vessel of the Polaris Megacorp, the Ilmarinen.[The Ilmarinen is a long-range exploration and mining vessel of the Kullervo Class. It was sent to deep space and returned infected by the LEGACY. The logs reveal what has happened and indicate that the Polaris Megacorp might have unintentionally reactivated the LEGACY threat that slept for nearly a millennium.
