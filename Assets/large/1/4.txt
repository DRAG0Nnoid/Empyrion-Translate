There isn't very much information available on the origin(s) of the Zirax Empire at this time, however Intel reports that the ancient Zirax were in touch with the 'Elder Talon' or 'Talon Guardian', and were given a technological boost from the advanced civilization. The Talon and Zirax were joined together in a technological and cultural Union, called the 'Talon-Zirax Assembly', which persisted for hundreds of years. It is not known yet why it collapsed, why they separated, or if it was a conspiracy. Files retrieved by the 2nd UCH recon unit indicated that the abominations found on the planets they occupied, seemed to have something to do with this or at least are related to a big incident in the past. These files were encrypted, classified and could not be deciphered until today. Their brutality and behavior towards the Talon or anyone not from a Zirax controlled faction, indicates that there is a lot more to uncover, than official reports tell us at the moment..
The rapid expansion directly affects how most of the Zirax bases are structured, which is clearly visible when entering the facilities. Zirax military structures are merely prefabs or standard templates. They are streamlined buildings with standardized functions, which enables the troops to get familiar with the base layouts before exiting a teleporter in a combat situation. Materials and specimens that UCH scientists have examined and brought back from those locations, have led to the impression that the facilities are “teleported” to the destinations as a whole. No one has seen this happen and there is no proof yet to say this is the case, so this is just a theory. [Zirax troops are often not stationed in the bases, and to maintain control of distant worlds within the territory of influence, troops will be teleported into central garrisons from an undisclosed location if a base is attacked. AI drones are mainly the first line of defense and surveillance, patrolling the area and guarding important POIs. These are controlled from a central server or by remote at a Drone base. Attack vessels in the outer rim territories operate similar to the AI drones. From what we have gathered from UCH troops on the ground who have captured a few of these vessels, these attack vessels are remote or AI controlled most of the time - with only few or even no crew at all, although the vessels are fully capable of transporting several hundred Zirax personnel. These vessels are  equipped with a self-destruction feature, which is triggered when the vessel is boarded by a non-Zirax crew. [There are rumors floating around that most of the Zirax enlisted foot soldiers are clones. This theory was brought up by a UCH science team while closely examining reports and video footage of an attack at a Zirax Bio-lab. During an interrogation of a lead scientist at the facility, the Zirax claimed that any further information could not be retrieved from the system. This may just be a diversion from the truth, since all the armored Zirax soldiers look identical to human eyes.
