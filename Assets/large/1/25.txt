[]FACTION MENU[]1. Open the NPC Faction tab in the Faction Menu[]2. Hover over a faction and find the reputation effects displayed on the right[]SPECIAL STANDING ACTIONS []As noted above, some of the aforementioned actions depend on a given standing level, eg. you can only do an action as long as you are on the correct standing level with the NPC faction member in front of you[]On Friendly State: []> able to trade with a faction trader[]> stay in territory (BA or vessel) without RP penalty[]> harvest plants without RP penalty[]> Use teleporters[]> Use their stations as respawn points[]On Honored State: []> get a discount at the faction trader[]> mine ore without RP penalty[]> spawn structure without RP penalty[]> (includes any from Friendly State)[]Player outside hostile territory[]When you are on HOSTILE stage with a faction you get RP for staying outside their territory until you dropped to UNFRIENDLY.[]Technical notes:[]- No reputation loss if opening container/device in any NPC faction POI that is set to 0000[]- Actions with a frequency, like ""StrucStayinTerritory"" will award the pt each 5 real time minutes (example)[]- All other: award “on impact/action/collect” (per hit, for example).
Factions are not necessarily friends to each other - they might even be rivals. Given the Lore behind those factions, certain actions you as a player (or faction) do in favor or against a faction might lead to your faction standing towards another faction changes.[]The faction rivalry info is available in the FACTION window when hovering over the faction entry.[]Missions for a faction might rise or drop your faction standing as well..
First: as soon as you join a faction, your RP with a faction are calculated into the factions. There is not ""private"" standing vs. any NPC Faction anymore, only the factions standing vs. the NPC factions.[]Example:[]2 Players founding a faction.[]Player A has a standing of 30.000 with Zirax (Honored)[]Player B has a standing of 0 with Zirax (Hostile)[]The Player-Faction that results will have a standing of (30.000+0)/2 = 15000[]Player C is joining with a standing of 0 (Hostile)[]The Player-Faction Standing will result in (15.000+15000+0)/3 = 7.500[]Player D joining wit a standing of 30.000[]The Player-Faction Standing will result in (30.000+7500+7500+7500)/4 = 13.125[]Player A is then killing a Zirax[]The Player Faction will drop to HOSTILE for all players[]Player D now leaves the faction.[]His private standing will then start again on the standing the faction had with the NPC Factions at this point. (You do not ""get back"" your initial private NPC Standing you might have had BEFORE joining the faction).
It does not interact at all. Scenario Creators CAN set up a NPC-Standing for players that join an ORIGIN. This is basically only the ""starting point"".[]The player in an Origin does NOT collect or contribute to the standing of the Origin to any NPC Faction, as there is no mechanic Player Origin vs. NPC Factions yet..
Levels ( Structures / Creatures ).
When pointing at a structure, NPC or creature you will notice a number in front of its name or HP-bar. This is the level of the Creature or the level of the NPCs in that structure.[]What effect does the level have?[]The Level is basically a MULTIPLIER of its attack (Damage of his weapon) and defense (Hitpoint) values.  []The Level is an additional multiplier to your decision if you want to play the whole game on a certain difficulty level!.[]Basic Multipliers for GAME Difficulty modes[]  - EASY = 0.5[]  - MEDIUM = 1[]  - HARD = 2[]Level multipliers for NPC/Creatures (0.1667-stepping)[]  - Level 10 = 2.5[]  - Level 9 = 2.33[]  - Level 8 = 2.17[]  - Level 7 = 2.00[]  - Level 6 = 1.83[]  - Level 5 = 1.67[]  - Level 4 = 1.50[]  - Level 3 = 1.33[]  - Level 2 = 1.17[]  - Level 1 = 1.00[]Reads: If you played on MEDIUM before and now run into a Level 10 NPC on the same difficulty level, the NPC is 2.5x stronger than in Alpha 8.[]How does this work?[]Example 1: You start the game on EASY and run into an NPC with level 10. His attack/defense values are multiplied with (0.5 x 2.5 ) = 1.25[]Example 2: You start a game on HARD and run into an NPC with level 10  = 2 x 2.5 = 5 x attack/defense[]Example 3: You start a game on EASY and run into a NPC with level 1 = 0.5 x 1 = 0.5[]Why do POIs also have a level and what does this mean?[]The level of a POI tells you which NPC-levels spawn there - with a slight variance: In a POI level 10  you can run into NPCs of level 7-10.[]Note: the level does not apply to devices on the structure or vessel, but ONLY to hosted NPCs.[]For Creators: where do i define the levels?[]For SSG [](Randomly created solar systems via Solar System Generator):[]  - Levels can be set in the SOLARSYSTEMCONFIG.yaml in the parameter ""PlayfieldLevel""[]  - The level of a playfield defines the maximum levels of the POIs and Entities (on terrain) that will spawn there.[]  - The level of the POI will then define the NPCs spawning inside[]You can give a RANGE for the PlayfieldLevel like: PlayfieldLevel: []Example:[]  - You set the range for playfield levels to [] in the SSG / Solarsytemconfig[]  - This means you can basically get  playfields between these ranges when the solar system is generated on game start[]  - On a playfield level 8 you can see a small variant of POI and Terrain-NPCs UP TO level 8 (like 6-8) but NEVER above 8[]For Fixed Systems[]The level can also be set DIRECTLY in the playfield.yaml, but WITHOUT a range.[]You can give an EXACT maximum Level for an individual playfield like:  PlayfieldLevel: 8[]This means you will get POIs and Terrain-Entities up to that level (with the same variance, like 6 or 7 might show up, but never 9 or 10)[]You can also increase the Level BY BIOME with a new parameter  added to the biome definition in the playfield.yaml.[]""LevelMod: +""[]Use any positive Integer value for , like +2 = the level of this biome is +3 higher than the game-start/main definitions have set it..
Energy creation / Power.
For powering a base you have two options:[]1. Conventional[]Craft and place a Fuel Tank and a Generator on your base. []You need to craft Fuel Cells or BioFuel and add it to the Fuel Tank ahead of activating the base![]2. Solar[]Craft a Capacitor (Solar) and Solar Panels.[]Place the generator and the cells on your base.[]Solar is not available for vessels.[]3. Activate the base with Y or go to the control panel (P) and flip the POWER switch.[]The Control Panel main screen and the STATISTICS page have detail info on your structures or vessels power consumption and production capabilities.[]Note: if you drain more power than your structure generates, your generators will explode after short![]For more detail and info, please, in the list on the left, click and open this chapters sub-headlines by []clicking on their headline[] and/or by clicking the []arrow-buttons []next to them.[].
The Attack and Defense values for COMBAT (artillery battle, large guns) and INFANTRY (troops) will allow you to judge how ""difficult"" or ""hard"" a dungeon is in general. Or how strong or weak a  base or ship of both players and NPC factions might be considered.[]- The values for player stations and vessels can be found in the blueprint window in the blueprint library (F2)[]- For NPC factions and vessels check their Empyriopedia entries on the list (if available)[]For more detail and info, please, in the list on the left, click and open this chapters sub-headlines by []clicking on their headline[] and/or by clicking the []arrow-buttons []next to them.[].
The formula is taking into account not only Damage, but also Rate-of-fire, Ammo Capacity and Reload Time![]- Turrets (not including sentries, tool and drill turrets..)[]- Fixed weapons (not including tools, drills).

Summarizes NPCs of all spawners in the station or ship, assuming the worst case.[]This means: If a spawner would spawn 5 NPCs either Zirax Soldiers or unarmed Civilians, the attack value will calculate the ""spawner value"" from 5x Zirax and not 5x Civilians.[]- Sentries[]- Weapons the NPCs are using as primary weapon.
Same as for INFANTRY Attack, but this time summarizing the 'worst case' hitpoints []- Sentries[]- NPCs max health.
Why no Hull Blocks?.
Hull blocks help to keep away damage from the interiors, like generators, fuel tanks etc. On the other hand, you cannot fly away without thrusters. So shielding the interior the best way possible might give you an edge in a battle, but the AMOUNT of Hullblocks does not give any clue if a lucky shot that went through a window is not just bad piloting skill. []Beyond that, sticking a lot of hull blocks into a large ship does not necessarily mean it is a strong ship, but just a well armored one. Acknowledging this might be a weak signal to be added to the calculation, for the time being we want to have the formula handle distinct values referring to a combat situation regarding the outcome of a ""technically comparable stalemate"" ..
The names COMBAT and INFANTRY are used in the loca/displaying areas use different internal ""working names"" and abbreviations:[]  - []Combat = Artillery Attack Defense[] (AAD)[]All the big guns and relevant devices that are usually on the outside of a ship or vessel, fighting other ships or vessels or bases = large scale ""artillery"" combat[]  - []Infantry = Infantry Attack Defense[] (IAD)[]Includes NPCs that spawn from a spawner plus Sentries (as they are not defined to combat vessels, but player/creatures/NPC
