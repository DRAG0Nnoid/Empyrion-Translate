Speak to the prisoner in the cage..
[Commander, I think you should look for the [bridge main console[ before we leave. [We might not find any remains of the crew, but maybe more info..

[There are now two possible directions you can try:[1. Use the secret teleporter behind the cargo containers in the room where agent Kezzel works, find the Small Vessel and escape with it.[2. Head back to your base or camp, install the teleporter and improve your gear at first, as we might run into more and better equipped Zirax troops around their garrison..
[ There is a damaged Hover Vessel![In case you want me to help you on that topic, have a [have a seat[ in the cockpit..
Simple Hover Vessels are usually equipped with GROUND REPULSOR engines, which means they can NOT go over water. For traveling over liquids, you need to upgrade them to HOVER ENGINES T1 or T2.
Open the Control Panel ([)..
The Control Panel works the same as for Bases. It will show missing devices in yellow in the DEVICEs tab..
Go to the [DEVICES tab[ and check the [YELLOW [entries.[These devices need to be added in order to allow the vessel to function..
A fuel tank is required for any vessel..
Same as for bases, the generator provides the energy for all devices..
Add some Fuel to the tanks and fire up the vessel, pressing ([) or using the POWER slider in the Control Panel..
Hover Vessels use thrusters and hover engines. They can be switched on and off individually either in the main Control Panel page or in the Device tab..
The Hover Vessel is now ready to drive! [1. Use [SPACE [and [C [to increase and lower the hover height of your vessel![2. In case you flipped your vessel upside down, use either [ or [SHIFT[ to upright it again![3. If your vessel handles too twitchy, open the Control Panel ([) and adjust the rotation sensitivity in the [STATISTICS[ tab.[4. If your vessel has spotlights, use [ to switch them on and off.[Note that this vessel has an [open cockpit[, which does not protect you from enemies or environmental dangers!  [You might want to add a [detector [device to the vessel, as this has much higher range than your handheld variant!.
[ The vessel should be around here somewhere. Use the detector to find it.[You might need to at least add fuel..
[ There it is!  Make sure no troops are around, fill the tank and fly us out of here back to our base..
Check [Control Panel[ ([) > [STATISTICS [for its performance parameters!.
Attention! This device requires a lot of energy when being activated! [Make sure you do not overload your generators, otherwise they will explode![Check the Control Panel (P) if your output is high enough! [If not, build more generators or deactivate the teleporter in the meantime..
In case the required power is higher than the output of your generators, the generators will get damaged and explode after a while!.
Credibility Mission - Talon.
The Credibility-Missions will ask you to do something in favor of the faction that really proves your worth to them.[As a reward you will get two [faction credibility seals.[Find an [ambassador [of the faction or connect to a [global information network[ (GIN) console on any trading station. One seal is used for each step from [hostile[ to [unfriendly [and [unfriendly [to [neutral[. You cannot improve your reputation with the faction beyond neutral with the faction credibility seals, though.[***[Notes:[- You can also earn the credibility seals by some story missions and quests, if available for this faction.[- The Zirax Empire credibility seal will increase your reputation with the Empire and all houses of the Empire![.
