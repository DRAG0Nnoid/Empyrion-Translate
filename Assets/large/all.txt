Although ... no coordinates. No flight vector..
At least the GRAND and most of the fleet survived this ambush.  They are probably safe, because the Zirax don't know where they went..

Story Chapter 9: [Unexpected Allies[You found Yarod, a former station AI that got in touch with a VOID artifact, which seems to have allowed him to develop his own personality. He has integrated himself into your suit and is now supporting IDA and you on your missions. He asked you to not reveal  him to the GLaD or any other organization. He might have a reason for this. And you possibly too.[You still do not entirely trust that organization called GLaD. Even the UCH itself has become a bit suspicious to you, based on what you learned from the TITAN logs -  but your recent endeavors also didn't bring you any closer to Alex or an answer that would explain what is happening.[So you have no other choice as to smile and try to stay in the game - which leads to finding an unexpected ally..[.
Story Chapter 10: [Wins and Losses[.
[Story Chapter 10: [Wins and Losses[Something unexpected happened: you found an ally within the Zirax Empire. The ambassador Hyzani of the House of Abyssal not only helped you to understand more about what makes the Zirax Empire tick, but also seems to know a lot about the events of the recent past. Especially about the LEGACY. And also about a mysterious, presumably extinct race named the PROGENITOR. [While you still try to fiddle out how the new information fits into the big picture, including the VOID and the TESCH, you are racing back to the GLaD outpost to reveal a possible traitor and save the crew from an already rolling Ghyst assault on the base..
Back to Asteroid Field.
Fly back to the GLaD outpost - and do not waste time!.
Go to Command Center.
Hello Commander! [I have a note for you: [Ensign Henrid[ wants to speak to you. [He can be found upstairs in the Crew Quarters..
Use the elevator behind the door to the left of the bartender. It leads up to the crew quarters, sleeping and bathrooms..

Sergeant Palant can be found in the loading dock on the lower level of the base..
[ Commander, I am measuring an increase in the particle density. Please - you have the only fully closed suit - reactivate the seals whatever it costs..
[ Commander, our communication array has just exploded!.
Ah .. the sound of treason![Palant! Gather the crew and get out of here. We are under attack! [I'll [go upstairs, [find [Mercer [and cover your back..
[ .. and you'll probably survive, Commander Mercer![.
Have a seat in your cockpit and send the code.
[ Sir, we did not get sent any coordinates and it seems all the vessels are already gone.  And now all the traces of a possible traitor are also eradicated...
[  Message incoming. It is from ambassador Hyzani!.
The system is marked on your map with '[High Security[': Find the spot where the Zirax and Kriel territory nearly touch. A few clicks behind the Zirax border, there should be the system.  Go there and warp to the local '[Asteroid Field['.

There isn't very much information available on the origin(s) of the Zirax Empire at this time, however Intel reports that the ancient Zirax were in touch with the 'Elder Talon' or 'Talon Guardian', and were given a technological boost from the advanced civilization. The Talon and Zirax were joined together in a technological and cultural Union, called the 'Talon-Zirax Assembly', which persisted for hundreds of years. It is not known yet why it collapsed, why they separated, or if it was a conspiracy. Files retrieved by the 2nd UCH recon unit indicated that the abominations found on the planets they occupied, seemed to have something to do with this or at least are related to a big incident in the past. These files were encrypted, classified and could not be deciphered until today. Their brutality and behavior towards the Talon or anyone not from a Zirax controlled faction, indicates that there is a lot more to uncover, than official reports tell us at the moment..
The rapid expansion directly affects how most of the Zirax bases are structured, which is clearly visible when entering the facilities. Zirax military structures are merely prefabs or standard templates. They are streamlined buildings with standardized functions, which enables the troops to get familiar with the base layouts before exiting a teleporter in a combat situation. Materials and specimens that UCH scientists have examined and brought back from those locations, have led to the impression that the facilities are “teleported” to the destinations as a whole. No one has seen this happen and there is no proof yet to say this is the case, so this is just a theory. [Zirax troops are often not stationed in the bases, and to maintain control of distant worlds within the territory of influence, troops will be teleported into central garrisons from an undisclosed location if a base is attacked. AI drones are mainly the first line of defense and surveillance, patrolling the area and guarding important POIs. These are controlled from a central server or by remote at a Drone base. Attack vessels in the outer rim territories operate similar to the AI drones. From what we have gathered from UCH troops on the ground who have captured a few of these vessels, these attack vessels are remote or AI controlled most of the time - with only few or even no crew at all, although the vessels are fully capable of transporting several hundred Zirax personnel. These vessels are  equipped with a self-destruction feature, which is triggered when the vessel is boarded by a non-Zirax crew. [There are rumors floating around that most of the Zirax enlisted foot soldiers are clones. This theory was brought up by a UCH science team while closely examining reports and video footage of an attack at a Zirax Bio-lab. During an interrogation of a lead scientist at the facility, the Zirax claimed that any further information could not be retrieved from the system. This may just be a diversion from the truth, since all the armored Zirax soldiers look identical to human eyes..
[The Empire seems to overstretch itself at an increasing rate, due to the extremely fast expansion rate. As a result, the Zirax government seems to fall short on capacities for building proper stations. This leaves them incapable of recruiting the necessary amount of specialized troops to fill these structures. This leads to a power vacuum in newly acquired systems, leaving them under strength and without order due to a lack of governance. The Kriel have recently started to challenge the Zirax and seized some of their star systems, as reports indicate.[.
The most influential and longest-standing houses of the Zirax empire are at date:[House of XENU[The military branch of the empire. Although the other houses have combat vessels and security forces, those are mostly XENU ships and bases, repainted in the house's color. The Xenu are everywhere.[House of RADOS[The house is handling all of the logistics within the empire and beyond. The members of the house also run nearly all of the Empire-owned trading and freighter routes.[House of EPSILON[Each and every com signal sent and transceived in the Empire has probably gone through one of the houses stations. Not only technically, but also in terms of approval of its content.[House of GHYST[The Ghyst are running the more delicate emplacements and handle everything that even only sounds like it is of vital interest to the empire.  [House of ABYSSAL[One of the first houses that formed long before the War of Silence took place. The inner circle of the Empire and the Empress herself is either approved by the Abyssal or is (in 90% of all cases) even one of theirs. The Abyssal have founded the technical basis of the Empire and are constantly pushing its development - by all means. The Abyssal have a strong ally in the [House of SERDU[. While this house is not that influential anymore, they are still the spiritual representatives of the Empire..
Alex Lamarr, Lt. Commander.
Jennifer Zerogen, Lt. Commander.
Vice Admiral J. Benner.
Vice Admiral C. Perez.
The companion and long-time partner to the player. She was on the TITAN when the failed warp jump happened and survived the events that followed. She is also known as Sectioner32 as the player finds out later. She has a central role in all events related to the UCH and GLaD storylines.[Note: the name  'Alex' was chosen intentionally, because it can be read as male (Alexander) and femal (Alexandra) variant. Originally the story was laid out to allow several combinations with the player avatar choice, but the game  currently can not alter NPC spawning according to the player's choice of gender (m/f). As soon as this changes, the part of ""Alex"" could be handled dynamically. For now Alex remains a female NPC.[.
Mercer (Senior) was joining Operation Phoenix as an undisclosed representative of 'the Council' - a secret organization that has an enormous influence in the UCH. His official role was a science officer on the TITAN..
The son of Mercer (Senior). He was on board of the UCH Heidelberg. He survived the destruction of the vessel. He is now part of the GLaD and 2nd in command..
Ensign John Emmerson, is an, often grumpy, specialist for research and reconnaissance in the GLaD. He once was a flight officer on the UCH Heidelberg. His dispute with the captain sent him to the flight deck, which might have rescued his life when the ship crashed on the planet..
The INTERNAL DATA ASSISTANT is helping the player with many of his tasks. IDA also has some secret features and is not a normal Suit-KI..
The Data Analyzation and Visualization Entity (D.A.V.E.) was the main AI of Apollon station. He helped the player to escape from the station and gave him an info package about what happened - which IDA later was able to decode..
THEIA was the main AI of the TITAN.
Dr. Paul Dawson was one of the two lead scientists on Apollon station and a good friend to Alex and the player. He was killed in the events of the Apollon station disaster..
Dr. Katelyn Greyson was the lead scientist on Apollon station and a good friend to Alex and the player. She was responsible for researching the alien artifacts found in the crashed ship. She might also have been responsible for the events that lead to her death and the Apollon station disaster..
Close friend to the player and Alex Lamarr. She is responsible for operations and Captain of the away teams in the GLaD organization..
Nicole Palant has been the Chief Engineer on board of the UCH Heidelberg. She survived the crash and followed Lamarr and Zerogen when they left the UCH. She is responsible for all technical stuff of GLaD..
Yarod is the nickname of the AI that once managed Sigma Fulcrum. When the infection of the VOID artifact compromised its systems, the brave scientist named Yarod Halden downloaded the AI to a Cyborg while the Polaris combat ships were already starting to take it apart. He luckily deactivated the Cyborg so the EMP weapon that destroyed the infected part of the AI and mostly the station did not delete the downloaded version. Years after the station was reactivated, a janitor activated the droid to help with maintenance tasks. After getting in touch with the VOID artifact the first time, the AI developed a personality and called herself Yarod from this time on. Yarod found out about a thread coming from the VOID artifact and became a temporary agent of the GLaD..
The player has worked with Chief Kuehn a lot on Apollon station. He was evacuated with one of the shuttles before the station exploded..
Admiral Ronald T. Yaden officially was running Operation Phoenix by executing the orders of 'the Council'. It is unknown if he knew what could happen. He and Mercer (Senior) left the TITAN in a shuttle before the vessel was destroyed..
Vice Admiral Jeremy Benner was 2nd in Command in terms of the Operation Phoenix Project. He also knew about the plans of 'the Council' but tried everything to prevent the bad things from happening. He and a lot of the TITAN crew died when they tried to drag away the Zirax forces from the UCH GRAND, so the latter could escape..
Vice Admiral Carmen Perez was captain of the UCH Grand, the sister ship of the TITAN. After the events of the arrival of the fleet and its close escape, she is now the highest rank in the fleet. After a dissent with some of the commanders about the most important steps (she favors the Project Eden), Lamarr and the others left the UCH and founded the GLaD.  Perez managed to convince them later to work for the UCH unofficially..
Chief SaintJohn was a master engineer on the Ilmarinen. Later, as the ship was nearly overrun, he was trying everything to slow down the ship so it would not return to its desired destination. He was partially successful, so the player could find his logs later and stop the Ilmarinen once and for all..
A mysterious visitor. He is a Talon, but obviously does not belong to the native tribes in this area of the galaxy. He has offered to help the player and the GLaD after he was rescued by the player from a Ghyst prison..
Ambassador Propa Moon Hyzani, member of the house of Abyssal of the Zirax Empire has become an unexpected ally to the player. She found out where the GLaD team and Alex were held captive and supported several missions that led to their rescue. It is unknown if this is a real partnership or if this is just a method to use the player to help the Abyssal with their troubles in the Zirax Empire later on..
Joe Henricks, Lt. Commander (player alias).
Commander 'Joe Henricks' is sometimes used as the player's alias name in logs and reports in the Journey Book. [The name was used in the original backstory. Joe can be read as male (f.ex. Joseph) or female (f.ex. Josephine) variant.[.

Dying / Backpack / Swimming / Faction.
[Q: I died and dropped a backpack – how does this work?[- A backpack will drop with your inventory stuff included. A small flag will be shown on your Radar Map (top right).[- Your backpack will vanish after 15 Minutes if you or someone else does not pick it up.[- Backpacks can be looted by anyone. They are not protected either in PvE or PvP playfields.[Q: How do I swim?[Empty your hands to swim. If you hold a weapon or tool in your hands, you will sink to the ground.[Q: What is the 'faction' setting in the Control Panel all about?[You can set a faction and decide who can use your stuff: [- Public = anyone can use/work on it with tools[- Public = only Owner can use / work on it with tools[- Faction = only Faction members can use /work on it with tools.
[Q: What is the Techtree (F3)?[- When you progress through the game (SP and MP) you gain XP for doing certain things. Each level up will add some Unlock points at your disposal. Use them to unlock more advanced stuff in the Techtree.[- A lot of basic blocks and devices can be built without having to be unlocked. [- If you think you are missing something in the template folder of your Constructor, have a look at the Techtree if it has been unlocked already!.
[Q: How does the Offline Protection work?[- If you have equipped a Capital Vessel or a BA with the Offline Protection Device, and your Base or Capital Vessel is either set to your faction, this will activate a shield when you leave the server. Your BA or Capital Vessel does NOT need to be powered and it does not use up fuel packs! [- The OP has a timer that can be set by the Admin. Default setting is 48 real-time hours (2 days). [- For factions with more than one member, the OP activates only if ALL faction members have left the server..
[Q: How to use the ALT-look Mode?[- Hit V to switch to the 3rd Person view. Then hit ALT only ONCE and the camera view gets undocked from your Player Avatar or Vessel. Use the mouse to move the camera view. Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out[- You can still walk/fly by using the Arrow-Keys and the WASD +Q/E commands[- The ALT-look mode also works in 1st Person, for example when sitting in a Cockpit!.
[Q: What is the difference between PvP and PvE planets/orbits?[When you open the map (M) you can see a list of planets and orbits. Click on one of them and you'll notice a green PvE or red PvP. This is more relevant for Multiplayer, though. [- [PvE:[ No other players can damage you or your vessel or base with weapons or tools. Only Alien drones and Alien creatures can do so. Vice-versa: you can destroy Alien bases with your weapons (but NOT with tools!) and any wildlife.[There is only one exception:[ As soon as you destroy the Core of an Alien POI and/or swap it with your own Base Core, the blocks of the structure are becoming immune to weapon fire. You need to work on this former Alien POI with the Remove & Repair tool.[- [PvP:[ Anything goes. You or your structures are NOT protected in any way as long as you are online. Build an Offline Protection device to protect your PvP-Bases and Capital Vessels while you are offline..
Global Game Mechanics - Part II.
[Q: What is the Registry?[The Registry is a repository of all your vessels, bases and more [Q: Where do i find the Registry[Open your inventory and find the Registry-button in the icon row on the top.[Q: What is the purpose of the Registry?[You can manage your Vessels and Bases from remote if you are in the same playfield.[- You cannot use all base features. For example you cannot access Constructors or Turrets from remote.[-You can set a persistent WAYPOINT to mark the targeted vessel or base on your HUD. This is persistent when leaving the playfield or game[Q:Which structures are listed in the Registry?[- Your private structures and vessels.[- Structures and vessels of your faction.[- and many more.
[Q: What are map markers?[A1: You can set notifications freely on your map. Just RMB on a spot on the MAP and give it a name. This will add your marker to your personal list.[A2: When you open the MAP, you will find your Map Markers in the upper right tab.[Q: How do i add a map marker?[1. Press M[2. RMB on any place on the map[3. Add a name[4. ACCEPT[Q: What is the WAYPOINT checkbox doing?[If you check this box, the marker will change to orange and will give you a direction. The marker can be seen through the playfield terrain.[Q: What is REMOVE ON APPROACH checkbox doing?[If you only want to set a temporary marker, check this together with waypoint and the waypoint mode will be cleared from your Hud when approaching (~50m)[Q: What are the 2-letter buttons on the right side doing?[PV = your private list of markers[PU = public list of markers. Use the SC button to share your PV marker to the PU list[SM = show marker on the map[ED = edit highlighted marker (you can also RMB the marker on the map)[RM = remove highlighted marker (also possible with RMB the marker on the map)[SC = Share marker to PU list[Q: Can i also add a map marker in space?[Of course!.
Temperature - Radiation - Weather.
[Q: How does Radiation work in general?[Some of the planets and space have a certain amount of radiation. Radiation does not rise or decrease, it is constant for the whole playfield. The player armors have different protection values (which can be boosted). The interior suit does NOT protect you from any RAD level![Q: Am i protected from Radiation inside a base or vessel?[Yes, even if it's deactivated. (this might be subject to change in the future)[Q: What happens if i am outside with a suit that does not protect me from the RAD level?[A1: Your body radiation (small upper number on the right environment info block) will pile up and lead to serious problems after short.[A2: Unlike with temperature, your BODY-RAD level will NOT automatically decrease if you return to a base or go back into your vessel. You need to use medication to reduce it ... or maybe take a shower? ;-)[Q: Does a hull breach in an radiated area lead to the inside of the base/vessel to be contaminated?[Currently there is no permanent contamination. But if you stand at the position of the hull breach, your radiation level might rise (although you are inside the base).[Q: Are there weather or environmental effects with radiation?[Yes! Occasional Radioactive Fog and Mist have been reported from some planets..
Temp and Rad for devices and blocks.
[Q: Do devices also have temperature and radiation?[YES! Some of the devices will heat up or radiate the area around them, like Thrusters and Generators and Warp Drives.[Q: Can other blocks have temperature and radiation as well?[ Yes. For example the green Alien Building blocks are radioactive.[Q: Does the heat 'flow' into the room?[Currently there is no 'transition zone'. For devices, the radiation/temperature is limited to a fixed perimeter of ONE block around them. This is subject to change in the future..
[Q: Is the weather dynamic?[Yes. Weather will change during day and night between the weather-options, given in the yaml of the planet.[Q: Which weather types are currently available?[A: Open console and type in 'help weather' > all available settings are visible there. You can also trigger a weather change there as admin or in Single Player.[Q: Does weather affect the player like with temperature or radiation increase/decrease?[Absolutely! You should go inside if a blizzard starts (if you are not equipped good enough) or if radioactive fog is rising.[Q: Does weather effects like meteors or lightnings damage player or structures?[A: A player can get harmed by sudden temperature rise/drops and radioactivity and by acid rain or fire rain/meteor fire storm. There is currently no effect on bases or vessels (yet)..
[Q: What do i need to oxygenate a base or vessel?[A1: You need an O2 tank and a ventilator. And your base needs to be powered.[A2: Place the ventilator in each room that you want to be oxygenated and add some O2 to the O2 tank. Open the control panel. Activate the base and tick the checkbox 'O2'. This will fill up all the rooms with a ventilator with O2 - given your O2 capacity is high enough. The ventilator needs to be 'active' of course.[A3: Use the DEBUG MODE in the Build Helper Menu (N) to visualize O2.[A4: If your O2 capacity/filing status is too low to oxygenate your base, the process will fail. Add more O2 Tanks or O2.[Q: How long does it take for a large room to be filled with O2?[This happens pretty instant (maybe a second or two)[Q: How do i know how much O2 i need to fill all the rooms that are connected?[Look for the OXYGEN stats in the STATISTICS tab of the Control Panel. There are three values given to indicate demand, tank size and current fillstate of the base.[- If a hull breach happens, the O2 in this room is lost, BUT the vents will not try to refill the affected room! So the ventilator is still active, but will not waste precious O2.[- If you deactivate your base and your O2 tanks are full, the O2 in your base is lost..
[Q: Are oxygenated rooms available for all vessels and structures?[Yes![Q: Do i consume less O2 when i am in an oxygenated room with helmet off compared to helmet equipped?[Yes! But you even use up your suit O2 less fast if your helmet is still unfolded in an oxygenated base.[Q: Are there different pressure levels?[No. The atmosphere in a room either has O2 or not.[Q: Which blocks are airtight?[A: Have a look at the block info panel for infos about airtight value. Most of the doors are airtight for example - but not all. Airtight doors have a blue containment field active while sealing a room[Q: Can i switch off the containment field of a door to let O2 flow?[Not yet.[Q: What happens if i open a door? Will O2 flow in the next room?[Basically no. There are non-airtight doors that do not hinder the flow of O2 either open or closed. All other doors (including hangar doors, shutter doors) have a sealing field to keep the O2 inside. This field cannot (yet) be deactivated manually, but depends on the global on/off status of the base.[Q: Does O2 get lost if i open a hangar door and deactivate the base?[No. If you deactivate your base, a decompressing sequence is run and all the O2 is moved back into the tanks (if there is enough room. If not, the excess is lost).[Q: Does O2 get lost if someone blasts a hole in may base / If i remove a block thats leading to a hole in the wall?[A1: IF this is a 'hull breach' to the non-O2 outside world or space either by damage or by removing the 'wrong block' the O2 in the room is lost.[A2: In this case, the Ventilator is not shut down, but it also will not try to refill the room. So no additional O2 is lost after the hull breach happens.[Q: Do players in my base use up the O2 in the tanks?[A: YES! If you are in your base (helmet off) you and any other player will use up a certain amount of O2 over time (reducing the total amount > T ).
Player Armor- Boosters - Durability - Repair.
[Q: Which player armors are currently available?[Light, Medium, Heavy. If you do not equip any suit, you are still wearing your Interior Suit'. This one has no protection from Temperature and Radiation, no Jetpack, no booster slots - but also is not limited in movement, jump height and other parameters.[Q: Can I build all of them?[Currently not. You can only build the LIGHT ARMOR. You need to find the MEDIUM and HEAVY suits in POIs/in loot.[Q: Do I lose player armor if I die?[No. You spawn with your last-used player armor equipped.[Q: How can I change my player armor?[You need to go to an Armor locker. Access the device and change suits or add/remove boosters[Q: Can I repair my player armor?[Yes. You need a REPAIR STATION. Just place the item in the inventory and click REPAIR.[Q: Can I store my armors in the Armor Locker?[A: Yes!.
[Q: Which types of boosters are available at the moment?[Armor, Jetpack, Temperature, Radiation, O2, Mobility, Multi, EVA.[Q: How many boosters can I use simultaneously?[Depends on the slots available. This is different for each Player Armor. Interior Suits have no booster slots.[Q: Are there limitations on how many boosters of the same kind I can use simultaneously?[No. You can for example stuff all of the slots with Armor Boosters...but you might also pile up the penalties each of the boosters has.[Q: Can I build all of the boosters?[No, boosters need to be found or traded. You cannot build them (yet).[Q: Where do I get boosters?[Boosters are available from loot. More possibilities will be added in the future.[Q: Do I lose boosters if I die?[Currently not. You are respawned in your last equipped player armor incl. the boosters that were added to this player armor[Q: How can I change / apply boosters?[You need to go to a Armor locker. Access the device and change suits or add/remove boosters[Q: Do I need to re-add boosters every time I change the player armor?[NO! The boosters are saved to your Player Armor slots. So you can stuff several player armors with a variation of boosters and just need to swap the player armor to have the setup re-applied!.
[Q: Which items are affected by durability?[T2 Weapons and Suits. (Basic weapons and tools currently have no durability: pistol, shotgun, assault rifle, sniper).[Q: How does durability work for weapons?[A: When you shoot the weapon there is a chance that durability is reduced.[Q: How does durability work for suits?[Durability is reduced when you get hit by a weapon. There is no 'idle degradation' for just using the armor or standing around, only damage.[Q: Can i repair my suit?[Yes. You need a REPAIR STATION. Just place the item in the inventory and click REPAIR.[Q: Can i repair my weapons?[Yes. You need a REPAIR STATION. Just place the item in the inventory and click REPAIR..
[Q: Are Instances limited for a number of players or by time?[Depends on how the creator has set it up. Can be done in the playfield.yaml of the instance. Instance:[Time: 100 # minutes until this instance has to be completed and players are kicked[MaxPlayers: 3 # portal closes after his amount of players entered[PortalOpen: 120 # seconds the portal is open[Cooldown: 90 # seconds the portal is closed after it was open (cooldown time)[Q: Can i re-enter my instance?[A1: Yes. The portal to your instance is shown purple in this case.[A2: Re-entering an instance is possible as long as the instance is 'alive' (TIME setting)[Q: Can other players follow me into the instance?[A1: Basically yes. They can follow you as long as a) there is more than 1 player allowed and b) in this case as long as the portal is open.[Q: Do i have to wait until a player or group has 'finished' the instance?[No, there can be multiple parallel instances.[Q: Can i use the blueprint library in an Instance?[Can be set on/off by the creator in the yaml of the playfield.[Q: What happens when the time runs out on a instance and i am still inside?[You get teleported outside the instance and either keep your stuff or lose all your stuff. This can be adjusted by the creator in the playfield.yaml.
How does SI Work?.
Here are a few basic SI rules you need to take into account: [1. Only blocks that are touching the ground will be 100% stable (does not depend on the material used) [2. You can only achieve 100% stability for a vertical row of blocks, if the lowest block is touching the ground. If you have a 100% stable block, a so called 'anchor block', you can build a vertical pillar on top of it as high as the sky. There is no vertical limit (yet). [3. If you add blocks to such a 100% stable pillar in any horizontal direction, so each block that is attached in a row, any additional block will have a lower stability - until the row reaches a breaking point. The maximum range or breaking point for a horizontal, floating, not supported beam made out of any of the four base materials is 12 blocks. Note: The anchor block will keep its stability, as there is no such thing as shear force (yet)! [Tip:[ if your line or area of blocks is showing weak spots, just build a supporting pillar! [4. Do not put heavy materials or devices on top of an already weak beam or weak foundation. You might risk the construction to collapse and your devices will be destroyed..
[Q: My base has suddenly broken apart. What did i do wrong?[- If you started a blueprint from Pre-Alpha, first start a creative game, switch off SI (Open Console with Tabulator button, enter 'SI off') and make a new blueprint. This will fix most of the problems – except a non-SI conform design.[- Hold N and select the SI Overlay to visualize the structural integrity of your base while building. [- Technical note: The SI is recalculated with every new block you are adding or removing - not in advance!.
[Q: Can I deactivate SI?[Yes, but only for Single Player. Open the Console (TAB by default) and type in 'SI off'..
Building - Part I.
[Q: Which building materials are available in the game?[You can choose from four different materials: [- [Wood:[ easy to acquire in large numbers from all trees (use Chainsaw or Harvester Module), but very low HP and Armor.[- [Concrete:[ a good and durable alternative to steel and very easy to craft in high numbers. You only need rock dust.[- [Steel:[ not changed.[- [Hardened Steel:[ the most durable material in the game, twice the hit points compared to steel – but also needs twice the time and resources to produce..
Block Shapes and Families.
[Q: How do I access the shapes for the building blocks (SURVIVAL & CREATIVE)?[Move a building block to your toolbelt. Highlight it and hit the RIGHT-MOUSE button. This will open the new block-manager with all the shapes.[Q: Which of the building blocks are organized in such 'block families', available with the new block-shapes menu?[Currently the following building blocks are organized that way: Basic Building Block Materials (wood, concrete, steel, hardened steel), Windows, Truss, Stairs, Walkways, Deco (beds etc.), Consoles (Deco), Artificial Indoor Plants and Alien Blocks (for creative only)..
[Q: How does the block rotation work?[You can rotate blocks BEFORE and AFTER you have placed them: [BEFORE:[ If you want to place a new block, you might notice a green line sticking out from the block. This is the ROTATION AXIS. Change with INSERT or DELETE (Default). If you use HOME or END (default), the block will rotate around the Axis line clockwise or counter-clockwise! Use PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN buttons to move the block up and down vertically! [AFTER:[ If you placed a block and would want to rotate it afterwards, you need to equip the Multitool and use its Rotation-Mode (Select via RMB). Aim at a block and you will see the ROTATION AXIS. From here, rotating the block works like when placing a new block (INS/DEL to change Axis, HOME/END to rotate the block)..
Block Lines and Planes.
[Q: Is it possible to place blocks as a line or in a larger plane?[YES! HOLD the left mouse button to drag a line of blocks. Hold STRG+left mouse button to create a plane area of blocks. Important Tip: when creating a plane, make sure your stand is higher than the area you want to place. This makes it a lot easier to drag the plane from the start- to the end-point without getting in trouble with your view. And: you cannot place an endless line or an endless plane..
Move Wireframe / Remove Dirt.
[Q: Do I need to flatten the terrain ahead of placing a base starter block?[No. You can move the preview- wireframe UP and DOWN ahead of placing it. Please have a look in the Options menu to which keys this action is currently bound to (Default Page Up and Page down).[Q: I have built my base into a hill and need to remove the dirt. Does the drill or flatten mode of the Multi Tool damage my base blocks?[No.[Q: How do i remove blocks without using the Multi Tool Tool in CREATIVE?[Use SHIFT-Right Mouse click (This has been changed from pre-alpha as right-click also brings up the block-manager now)[Q: The night is so dark – what can I do?[Place some work lights! [Tip:[ The Player Drone (F5) can do ALL of the building tasks as well!.
Building - Part II.
[Q: Can I use a mirror mode when building?[Yes. Open the Build Helper Menu (N) and select the mirror plane you want to use. Click on a block of your vessel that should serve as the 'mirror axis'. . A mirror plane will be shown. A second click will move the mirror plane between CENTER and EDGE.You can only use one mirror plane at a time..
[Q: Is it possible to paint devices like stairs or generators?[Yes![Q: Is it possible to apply a texture or a paint to a whole block?[Yes. Just tick the 'apply to all sides' button in the paint/texture menu.[Q: Why do the available textures change in my tool while pointing at different blocks?[The available textures are split in two sections: [1. Common textures that are available for all block materials. [2. Special textures that are only available for certain materials.[The Special Textures are automatically loaded to the menu when pointing at a block with the texture tool!.
[Q: How can I switch the opacity of the standard windows?[Equip the Multi Tool and set it to Rotate mode via RMB. Then aim at the window and left-mouse-click to swap the opacity (this does not work for the windows with blinds!).
[Q: Do I need to walk up to any of my devices to adjust their settings, for example for changing the color of lights?[There are several ways you can work on the devices of a base or vessel[1. Walk up to a device, aim the crosshair at it and hit P. The Control Panel will open the device detail page! (You need to be in physical touch with the base or vessel!) [2. Open the Control Panel (P) and use the list on the left to open the detail page.
[Q: Can I rename a base or vessel?[Yes. Open the Control Panel (P) and change the name of your base in the lower right corner of the info screen. Hit ENTER to save the name.[Q: Can I rename the devices of a base or vessel?[Yes. You first need to add them to a group manually or by using the auto-group feature. Then open the detail page of a device by selecting it from the list. Change the name in the top-middle box (next to NAME). Hit ENTER to save the name! [Please note (current limitations): [- Ungrouped devices cannot be renamed. [- Using auto-group a second time after having renamed devices will reset the renamed devices to the standard name!.
Vessel - Part I.
No O2 in Cockpit.
[Q: I am dying from a lack of O2 while sitting in a cockpit![You need to add an O2 tank, filled with O2 bottles to your vessel. Otherwise you'll use up your suit O2. This also applies to Passenger Seats in any vessel.[NOTE: This only applies to a non-O2 environment. You will NOT die from a lack of O2 if your vessel is in an O2-rich environment (oxygenized Hangar or Planet).
CV turns only very slowly.
[Q: My Capital Vessel turns very slow and I hate dragging the mouse for hours?[Either add more RCS or use the ARROW KEYS for turning your Capital Vessel! Combine both and steering a large Capital Vessel will become much easier!.
[Q: Can I add more than one cockpit to my vessel?[Of course! But remember: [- The player that enters any cockpit AT FIRST will be the pilot of the ship. [- If this cockpit is 90° or 180° to your mounted weapons, this pilot will not have the mounted weapons on this toolbelt/at his disposal. [- Only players that sit in a cockpit parallel to the alignment of any mounted weapon can use them..
Vessel - Part II.
[Q: Can I dock a Small Vessel or a Hover Vessel to a Capital Vessel?[Yes, but the to-be-docked vessels need to be in the same faction as the Capital Vessel you want to dock it to. Exception: if the Capital Vessel is set to public, any private vessel can dock.[Q: How does docking work in particular?[Your Vessel needs to be equipped with docking pads or landing gears attached BELOW the vessel corpus. Adding docking pads on the sides or on the top will not dock the vessel to the Capital Vessel! [Move your Small Vessel or Hover Vessel onto the Capital Vessel. Lower the vessel with C and the Vessel will dock itself. There is no Docking-Key. Just have a look at the info screen on the right. It will show you a 'docked: ' with YES or NO. To undock, just hit SPACE and fly away..
Access Devices / Turrets Mid-flight.
[Q: Can I reload my turrets or manage my constructors while flying around?[You can access a turret or any device from a cockpit or a passenger seat! You can also reload your ammo containers or manage your constructors while sitting in the cockpit or passenger seat in mid-flight. Simply open the Control Panel (P) and use the ACCESS button of the device – or just double-click on it! Use the BACK button to return to the Control Panel or use T (default) to exit the view..
[Q: How do I warp with a ship?[Warping is currently only possible with Capital Vessels. [1. Add a warp drive and a warp tank to the vessel. Search for the blue crystals, turn them to Pentaxid (in a Constructor) and put them into the warp tank. Each jump will use up a given amount of Pentaxid, but Blue Crystals can be found all over the Solar System. (See Chapter 'Harvesting and Resources') [2. To do a warp jump, fly to space, open the Space Map (M) and click the Solar System Tab. You will see a list of jump destinations on the left. Select a destination from the left and click on 'LOCK TARGET' on the bottom right. [3. A blue crosshair will appear in your view or on the side of your helmet. Turn your vessel towards the blue rectangle, accelerate to at least 60 m/s and hit K (default) to jump.[Q: Can my passengers take a seat in a docked vessel while warping?[NO! Your passengers need to take a seat in a passenger seat in your Capital Vessel when warping, when flying to space or back to a planet. Otherwise they might get dropped out and will be left behind..
[Q: The range of the weapons says XX meters, but it does not seem to hit anything![Check the EFFECTIVE RANGE info on the bottom right! On a planet, the range will be much lower, depending on the density of the atmosphere..
Damage of Tools / Chainsaw.
[Q: Does the Multi Tool, Harvester or the Chainsaw Damage own or enemy blocks or enemies at all?[No, with one exception: the chainsaw can be used for close combat fights..
[Q: Can Enhanced Weapons be crafted?[Yes, but you will need the appropriate Weapon Kit, which cannot be crafted, but only be found or traded..
Turrets and Mounted Weapons.
[Q: How do I reload / add ammo to my guns and turrets?[- You need to build an ammo box and add it to your base or vessel. Then find out which ammo your guns need and just put it in the ammo box. The ammo box does not need to be near the turret. Keep it in a safe place[- Turrets will reload themselves from the ammo box. Fixed guns on Small Vessel/Hover Vessel and Capital Vessel will also reload automatically if you keep the fire button pressed. [- You can access a turret or any device from a cockpit or a passenger seat! You can also reload your ammo containers or manage your constructors while sitting in the cockpit or passenger seat in mid-flight. Simply open the Control Panel (P) and use the ACCESS button of the device – or just double-click on it! Use the BACK button to return to the Control Panel or use F (default) to exit the view. [- You can enter a turret and reload or shoot it manually! [- You cannot warp or fly to space or down to a planet while sitting in a turret!.
Turret Access and Targeting.
[Q: How do I access a turret for a Hover Vessel and Capital Vessel?[Enter the cockpit or a passenger seat. Open the Control Panel (P) and find the turret in the list on the left. Then, either select the turret and use the ACCESS on the top right screen OR just double-click the turret to activate the gunnery HUD. Use F (default) to exit the turret.[Q: How do I access a turret in a Base?[Use the Control-Panel as described above OR stand next to a turret and hit F (default) to enter it.[Q: How does turret targeting work? (Base/Capital Vessel/Hover Vessel?[Turrets are AI-controlled guns that will shoot on any target that is set in their detail screen. To change their target behavior, open the Control Panel and select the turret from the list. You can activate/deactivate or change the targeting parameters in the 'Attack' overview. [- Other Factions = anyone that does not belong to YOUR faction (Private is also a faction!) [- Alien = Alien Drones, Soldiers and Crawlers[- Predator = Fauna that will attack you without being provoked (like Wood Walkers or Plant Monsters). Also includes the Talon on Akua (despite that they do not attack when not provoked)[- Prey = Fauna that will not attack you (unless being provoked).[Q: Can I apply the targeting settings to a turret group?[A: Yes. In the device list, group the turrets, then click on the header of the group. On the right side you will get all the targeting settings. Set the checkboxes and use APPLY to group.[A: Orange checkbox = not all of the turrets in the group share the same setting on this targeting option..
[Q: How does the Player Drone work (F5)?[The drone is a building helper. It can use all building features including placing blueprints and using the Remove & Repair tool. It cannot use ALL tools or weapons yet. [Hit F5 to spawn the Player drone. It does not cost you resources or energy to do so, but it has a limited range. If you keep going farther away, the view will get distorted and finally be cut off. Your drone is lost. You can recall it using F5. [If the drone is destroyed by other players or just lost, you will not lose its inventory, as the inventory or blocks in the toolbelt are technically still in your players inventory/toolbelt..
[Q: How to create or join a faction?[- Open your inventory and click the Faction button. Just create one as you see fit. [- You can join an existing faction or manage your faction (candidates) from the same screen.

[Q: Is it possible to revert the faction status of a vessel or base back to public or private?[Yes, but only the Faction owner can do that..
Offline Protection for Faction Property.
[Q: Does the Offline Protection also protect all our faction structures in PvP?[Of course, but for factions the Offline Protection only activates, if no one of your faction members is on the server anymore!.
Set Single Device to Public.
[Q: Can I set specific devices like passenger seats for public use?[Yes! Just access the device via Control Panel and set a lock code. For public access use 0000.
[Q: Is there a way to mark a faction as a 'friendly ally' allowing them to use our devices?[YES! You can send an alliance request to a befriended faction!.
[Q: Is it possible to access Containers or Constructors remotely, other than standing next to them?[Yes! Open the Control Panel (P) and use the ACCESS button for devices like Turrets, Constructors, Containers and more! You can also DOUBLE-CLICK on the device! Use the BACK button on the top left corner of the screen to get back to the Control Panel or use F (default) to exit the view.[Q: I cannot open any turret on my Hover Vessel or Capital Vessel when standing next to them and using F?[For turrets on vessels you need to use the ACCESS button from the Control Panel as they cannot be accessed directly when standing next to them..
Renaming and Advanced Stats.
[Q: Can I rename a base or vessel?[Yes. Open the Control Panel (P) and change the name of your base in the lower right corner of the info screen. Hit ENTER to save the name.[Q: Can I rename the devices of a base or vessel?[Yes. You first need to add them to a group manually or by using the auto-group feature. Then open the detail page of a device by selecting it from the list. Change the name in the top-middle box (next to NAME). Hit ENTER to save the name! [Please note (current limitations): [- Ungrouped devices cannot be renamed. [- Using auto-group a second time after having renamed devices will reset the renamed devices to standard name![Q: There is a STATISTICS TAB in the Control Panel?[This provides more in-detail info about your vessel or base. For vessels, you'll get an expanded view with torque diagrams and other useful details!.
[Q: I noticed I can group devices in the Control Panel of a base or a vessel – are there more features available here?[Yes. For example: If you group all of your forward and rear facing thrusters into separate groups, you can activate and deactivate them individually.[Q: Are these group-setting functions available with all device groups?[Not yet..
Change Faction / Ownership.
[Q: Where can I set my vessel or base to private or faction?[Open the Control Panel (P) and select your faction from the dropdown on the bottom right. [- Public = anyone can use/work on it with tools[- Private = only Owner can use / work on it with tools[- Faction = only Faction members can use /work on it with tools [Note:[ Private or Public are also counted as a 'faction' (technically).
[Q: What is the effect of the HOME selection in the Control Panel ?[You can make one of your Bases or Capital Vessels your HOME. This will open up a new Respawn-option in the Respawn menu. The difference to all other options: Even if you die in a remote place (like on another planet or in space with no possibility to escape), the HOME option will teleport you back to this Capital Vessel or BA – even if it is not in the same playfield! [Note:[ Build either a Medic Bay (Level 7) or a Clone Chamber (Level 1) for setting the Respawn point more precisely[Q: What is the Clone Chamber all about?[If you tagged on of your BA or Capital Vessel as HOME without having a Clone Chamber or Medic Bay built, you will teleported back close to your HOME. With a Clone Chamber (or Medic Bay) you will spawn exactly where this device is located at![Q: Can I tag more than one BA or Capital Vessel as HOME?[No. Only on Capital Vessel or BA of yours can be set to HOME at any time..
Triggers - Sensors - Signal Logic.
[Q: What are 'triggers'?[A1: In 6.0 we added a range of sensors that can send a signal to devices, thus changing their operation parameters. For example: pull a lever and have a door closed or a light switched off.[ A2: Current triggers / sensors: Trigger plate, Light barrier, Motion sensor, Lever..[Q: Are there different types of sensors?[A: Yes! The lever has a defined On/Off status. If you move it into ON position, the signal is sent constantly to the device. Most of the other sensors are 'switches'. They only send the signal as long as a player or the vessel is in their detection range. See more details in EXAMPLES in 'How to setup'..
[Q: What can we do with basic triggers / sensors at the moment?[Basically create simple logics: Activate devices, Open / close devices, Lock / unlock devices. Different devices may offer some, all or a selection of these actions (Depending on what the device can do)[Q: Can i create more complex circuits?[Yes, see the chapter about SIGNAL LOGIC![EXAMPLES (for easy sensor-trigger builds)[= Modes =[1. FOLLOW[ Lever: Move handle to ON = ON. OFF = OFF[Switch: Enter the trigger area = ON, Leave the trigger area = OFF[2. TOGGLE[Lever: Do not use with lever (works, but you might need to pull the handle 2x to get an effect)[ Switch: Enter and leave the trigger area = switches the status of the device (to ON if OFF, to OFF if ON)[3. ON and OFF[Lever: Do not use (makes no sense)[Switch: sets status of the device to a dedicated ON or OFF status (not using its previous state!) Triggering the trigger again will not have an effect (ON-TIME-change)[= How to SETUP =[1. Place a trigger (let's use a trigger plate)[2. Face the Trigger Plate and hit P[3. If the Trigger Plate is highlighted in CP, you'll notice a new text below the device list: Tx Signal [4. Enter TEST to the field and hit return[5. Place a Light[6. Face the Light and hit P[7. If the Light is highlighted in the CP, you'll notice a new entry ON/OFF as well as two dropdowns and a checkbox with an ' I ' below the device list[7a: Expand the first dropdown and you'll find your TEST command. Select the TEST command to connect the Light to your Trigger Plate[7b: Expand the second dropdown > You can use FOLLOW, TOGGLE, ON and OFF to trigger the Explosives.[Now ...[- IF you want a Player to have the light switched to ON or OFF when he touches the trigger plate, use either ON or OFF[- IF you want the light to switch to OFF if it was ON (or vice versa), use TOGGLE[- IF you want the light to only shine as LONG as the player is on the plate, use FOLLOW[- IF you want the light to dim as LONG as the player is on the plate, use FOLLOW and toggle INVERT ( I checkbox).
[Q: Can i trigger several devices from the same sensor?[YES! Just use the SAME signal name in each of the devices. This way it is possible to - for example - switch a range of lights on or off with only one button/sensor[Q: Can i trigger a device from several sensors?[Yes, just use SIGNAL LOGICs![Q: Can i trigger the NPC spawners (for POI design)?[Yes! Place the NPC spawner and switch it OFF in the Control Panel. Then just connect your sensor. If a player triggers the sensor, the NPCs will be spawned.[Q: Can i trigger the PORTAL (for Instances)?[Of course![Q: Can i adjust the range and area of sensors?[For some sensors like motion sensor and light barrier, this is possible. Just access the sensor (aim at it and hit P) and you'll see its range and a range slider.[Q: Do sensors only trigger for players and vessels?[A1: Yes, sensors trigger for both player avatars and vessels.[A2: Please note: Motion Sensor and Light Barrier are active as long as a player or vessel is in their field of view. They do NOT deactivate if you just stand still at your position!.
[Note: Signal Logic is an extension of the Signal/Trigger mechanic, offering new ways on how to connect sensors and triggers in certain, more elaborate ways. Hit the SIGNAL LOGIC button on top of the Control Panel to access.[Q: What is the purpose of SIGNAL LOGIC circuits?[They allow you to do things that the standard device-based signal-dropdown would not allow you to do, like connecting different sensors to a several other devices.[Q: How do I use it?[Pretty much the same as you would set up a sensor-trigger array..but with more parameters/options/gates, like AND, OR, XOR, Inverter, Delays (more planned).[Q: How do I set it up?[Same as above: Have some sensors placed at your structure. Access them directly or via Control Panel and give them a unique signal name. Then open SIGNAL LOGIC, add a new circuit. Select your sensor signal on the left side. Add a name for the output signal on the right side. Go to the devices that you want to manage with the circuit and add the output signal to your devices signal dropdown.[Q: What are the different gates doing?[AND = All sensors added to the circuit need to trigger for the signal to be sent. Example: If you have 2 trigger plates, the light will only be lit if both plates are triggered at the same time (one player standing on each)[OR = If one or more of the added sensors are triggered, the signal is sent to the device. Example: A light is illuminated if you stand on one of the trigger plates, but also if both plates are triggered.[XOR = sends signal only if only ONE of the two attached sensors is activated. Does not trigger if both sensors are active. Example: the light will only illuminate if exactly one plate is triggered. If both are triggered, no signal is sent and the light remains dark.[ INVERTER = inverts the signal (f.ex. to OFF if an ON signal is sent). Example: A light is switched off if you step on a trigger plate. Also useful when you have two triggers and you need them both to be the same in order to pass an AND gate.[SET/RESET Latch = Use for two sensors: sensor A sets and sensor B resets if triggered.[DELAY = creates a simple delay modificator for a single-signal. Click on the button-box to add a value (seconds)[Q: Can I combine the signals coming from a circuit and use it in a new circuit?[Of course! Just use the outgoing signal name and select it for the input side. You can create complex circuits this way. Of course you should not delete the underlying circuit for your enhanced circuit or it will break the queue..
[Q: How do I create a blueprint?[You need to be in touch with your vessel or at least quite close to it. Aim at it with the crosshair and hit right ALT+O (default). The Blueprint library will pop up and give you three options: SAVE AS, OVERWRITE or CANCEL. Use SAVE AS, type in a cool name and you are done! From now on you can always use your blueprint in and Single Player or Multiplayer game![Q: Why should I create a blueprint of my Base or Vessels?[There are several good reasons:[- The Game is still in Alpha, so your save game might get broken. If you blueprinted all your stuff, you can easily recover from a messed up situation! [- Blueprints allow you to work on a design in Creative mode – and use the blueprint elsewhere (Multiplayer AND Single Player).
Build a Blueprint / Factory.
[Q: How do I spawn a Blueprint / How does the FACTORY work?[The following applies to a standard Single Player- or Multiplayer Survival game. [1. Open the Blueprint Library (F2). You'll see a list with all of your blueprints on the left and an info panel on the right. [2. Select a Blueprint from the list and use the button TO FACTORY[3. Add resources to the Factory intake, until all slots of the resource list are green. [Tip:[ You can reduce the waiting time for the blueprint to be finished down to nearly zero if you add more complex blocks like devices instead of ingots! [Note:[ You cannot remove resources from the factory yet – but you can use it for the next blueprints as the resources are stored. [4. Start the production and wait. You'll get notified when your blueprint is ready! [5. If you see the message of your blueprint being finished, open the Blueprint Library again, scroll to the top of the list on the left and select the finished blueprint. [6. Use the SPAWN button to place the blueprint in the world. [NOTE: You need a base platform if you want to spawn CV, SV and HV. You can spawn SV and HV also on a CV.[Tip:[You can move the blueprint wireframe around ahead of placing it: use PAGE UP/DOWN and HOME/END! Please have a look in the Options menu to which keys this action is currently bound to (Default: Page Up / Page down). [Important:[ If you are playing on a server from different PCs, make sure all of the PCs have the same blueprints available in the /Blueprints folder!.
[Q: Is there a shortcut /cheat to spawn my blueprint immediately?[Yes, there are two situations where you can skip the waiting time: [1. In a Single Player Game (Survival) or as an Admin/Mod/Gamemaster on your server (Survival), open the Blueprint Library (F2), highlight the desired blueprint and click TO FACTORY. You do NOT need to add resources! Just open the Console (Tabulator by default) and enter 'finishbp'. [2. When playing in a Creative Single Player- or Multiplayer Game, you just need to open the Blueprint library, select the desired Blueprint and hit SPAWN..
[Q: How do I upload my Blueprint to the Workshop?[Just hit the PUBLISH button when having selected a blueprint from the list. A completion message will pop up on the top right if your Blueprint has been uploaded to the workshop.[Q: Can I update a blueprint and have it replace my already published workshop item?[Of course. Spawn your Blueprint in a Survival or Creative game and make the changes you want to update. Then save the changes by OVERWRITING the original blueprint (right ALT+O -> select your blueprint -> OVERWRITE). Then hit the UPDATE button. It may take a few seconds until the blueprint is published/updated. A message on the top right will notify you about the upload process being completed..
[Q: I can't create a Blueprint?[Do you own the building or vessel you are trying to blueprint? You can only blueprint structures that are either owned by you (Private) or by your faction.[Q: My Base (placed from pre-Alpha blueprint) explodes when changing any block!?[If you want to place a blueprint from Pre-Alpha, start a creative game first, switch off SI (Open Console and enter 'Si off') and save as a new blueprint. This will fix most of the problems – except a non-SI conform design.[Q: Do I need to flatten the terrain ahead of placing a blueprinted base?[No. You can move the blueprint wireframe around ahead of placing it.Please have a look in the Options menu to which keys this action is currently bound to (Default Page Up and Page down).[Q: I have placed my blueprint-base into hill and need to remove the dirt. Does the drill or the Filler & Flatten tool damage my base blocks?[No.[Q: Will subscribing to a blueprint in the workshop while the game is running update it immediately?[Yes. It may take a few seconds, though.[Q: Some of my Blueprints in the Library are RED. What does this mean?[This is either a result of the blueprint being not compatible with your current game version OR the blueprint contains forbidden blocks (like Alien Turrets, Alien Core, Monster Spawners, Loot Containers). You can load the blueprint in CREATIVE mode, remove the forbidden blocks, then save it and then you should have it available in Survival Mode again..
[Q: How do I remove blocks in Creative Mode?[- Either use the Multi Tool or hold any block in your hands and use SHIFT-Right Mouse Click. [- The R&R tool will not remove blocks on both sides of an active mirror plan. Only deleting blocks with the SHIFT-Right Mouse method will do so..
Paint and Texture Mirror.
[Q: Can I use both the paint- and texture gun with the mirror mode?[Yes!.
[Q: Do I need to harvest and gather materials in Creative?[No, you do not. Just click H (Default) and you have all blocks at your disposal (Single Player and Server).
[Q: Can i create a POI in Creative Mode and use it in my custom game?[Yes, YOU CAN! [1. Go to your In-game Blueprint library (F2) [2. Double-click any BASE (Small Vessel/Hover Vessel/Capital Vessel won't work) [3. Set a group name[4. Use the group name in your customized playfield.yaml[If you want creatures spawn in your base, create that base in CREATIVE and add the Monster-Spawners. Same applies for the Alien POI loot containers..
Console Commands and Administration.
Access Console and Commands.
[Q: How do i use Console Commands in Single Player (Survival/Creative)?[- Just open the Console (see Options > Controls) and enter 'help'.

Like 'help faction' will show you everything you need to know about the faction command[- Console commands only work on a multiplayer server if you are either Admin, Moderator or Gamemaster![Q: How to use Console Commands when playing on a (local) Dedicated Server (Creative/Survival)?[You can't. The owner or an admin of the server needs to promote you to the Gamemaster permission group at least..
[Q: How to destroy or delete a base from in-game (as admin)?[Enter 'di' in the console and an overlay will be added on top of your screen. Go close to a base or a vessel and point at it. The overlay will tell you the ID of the Base/Vessel. Use the ID with the 'destroy' command..
[Q: How to make myself admin of my local Dedicated Server (self hosted)?[- Use TELNET (Microsoft Service included in Windows) and use the setrole command.[- Alternatively use the adminconfig.yaml example file available/explained here: http://bit.ly/EGSadminfile[Q: How to make myself admin of my rented Dedicated Server?[Use telnet (via remote console) or talk to your hoster to update the adminconfig.yaml accordingly..
Promote to Permission Group.
[Q: How to add players to a specific permission group?[As soon as you are promoted to Admin status, you can EITHER use Telnet OR the ingame-console to achieve that. Use 'help setrole' to learn the syntax and the values you can use..
[Q: Is it possible to deactivate the HUD-PDA Tasks shown on the right side of the screen?[Of course. Open the PDA (F1) and deselect the 'Activate HUD' toggle..
[Q: I got stuck in a PDA Task, what can I do?[Some of the tasks can be completed manually. Just tick the checkbox in front of the task and it will be completed..

If you need to know your EPD, open the explorer and go to one of your savegames PLAYER folder: ../Steam/steamapps/common/Empyrion - Galactic Survival/Saves/Games/YourSavegameName/Players/..[You'll find a file with the .ply ending there. The numbers are your EPD. [Note:[ Do not mix up the EPD with your Steam Account or Web ID. The EPD is a player ID unique to the game. The Steam Account/Web ID is the ID you are using on steampowered.com or other Steam-related topics (like for the webshops or login to websites)..
[Q: How to report an issue with the game?[If the issue can be reproduced, head over to the forums at empyriononline.com and report your bug in the bug threads. [Find advice on how to report bugs over there in the pinned threads.!.
[Q: How does saving a game work?[ There are three ways: [1. [AUTOSAVE:[ The game autosaves every time you leave an ongoing session (ESC -> Door symbol), overwriting the initial save game. [2. [MANUAL SAVE:[ If you hit ESC you'll notice a SAVE button designed like a disk. When you hit the SAVE-button a new save game will be created with the extension _BACKUP. If you hit the button repeatedly, the _BACKUP extension will get added some numbers[3. [COPY SAVE:[ From the main menu, open RESUME GAME. Select a save game and use the COPY button. This will create a manual backup with a _COPY extension. [Please note:[ you cannot load a save game while in-game, yet..

Plan AHEAD what you need to pick up and mind the VOLUME and MASS limit of your suit! [4b. Try to build a Portable Constructor early on to store the surplus! [5a. Deco Rocks will not hold any ore, but different amounts of Crushed Stones, which can again be made into some Ores! [5b. Avoid getting trapped in a mine shaft by using your PERSONAL DRONE (F5) for mining. [6. Cold and Heat can be countered either by the [Portable Heater/Cooler[ (Survival Constructor) or Hot- and Cold Beverages/Juices! [7. Do grab anything you run into, but mind that most of the edible items will SPOIL/Perish. [7a. Craft higher tier items from your collected items asap! Those have an increased perish time and do not spoil that fast![7b. Plants will regrow - if you find a rare plant, mark it on your minimap with a waypoint! [Check Empyriopedia > Game Mechanics Q&A > Global Game Mechanics Part II[ for more info on how to do that! [8. Remember, that other players cannot see your markers, even when they are in your faction!. You need to SHARE your markers on the MAP (M) and other players need to pick them FROM the MAP screen! [9. The PORTABLE CONSTRUCTOR can build a LIGHT ARMOR in the PORTABLE CONSTRUCTOR, but you need a ARMOR LOCKER (in a vessel or your base) to equip it! The Locker is also craftable in the Portable Constructor [10. Read the JOURNALS and GUIDES in the list on the left for MORE INFO about gameplay and environment![.

United Council of Humanity (UCH ).
Galactic Liberation and Defense (GLD).
Summary[The UCH was founded as a NGO back in the early 22nd century to research the predicted collapse of the Terran ecosystem. By the end of the 24th century, after the wars and catastrophic events leading into the 'dark 23th century' calmed down more and more, the UCH was re-founded as kind of a worldwide government by the surviving nations and local governments. Power was granted to the UCH authority to take care of the survival of the Terran civilization.[History[With the discovery of the alien ship in 2402 AD, the dark era for mankind ended all of a sudden. The UCH, founded nearly a century before, was able to use the find and retrieve most of the technological knowledge buried in the ice of Antarctica. This phase did not last very long as this new technology required some materials that were not obtainable in earth's solar system, but in the nearby Proxima Centauri system. Operation Phoenix, which was Earth’s last ditch effort to save itself from falling back in the dark age, was spearheaded by its flagship, the TITAN. The voyage was troubled by an unknown energetic effect, leading to the arrival in Andromeda, instead of the targeted Proxima Centauri. UCH vessels made first contact with a species known as the Zirax. Outgunned and caught off guard by the enemy, losses were abundant in the initial contact with this new species. Ships, crew members and materials were lost in an instant and Earth’s flagship the TITAN was destroyed and nearly all of the UCH’s leading officers were killed. The remaining ships, including the 2nd command ship GRAND, managed to retreat from the battle. They were able to hide in deep space, out of range of the Zirax Empire.  [Scientists are still gathering data and examining whether the term 'Empyrion' used loosely throughout history is a physical location or a spiritual/philosophical belief..
Summary[The Galactic Liberation and Defense group has strong relationships to the UCH. It is said that some of the personnel of the former Operation Phoenix fleet have joined their ranks. The purpose of the group is to support the Talon against the Zirax oppression. There are more but yet revealed reasons for this group to exist, though..
[The Ziraxian Empire is a militarist oligarchy and the largest power in the galaxy Andromeda. It is ruled by a series of houses, each with a specific function or functions that relates to a sphere of influence. These houses each produce a representative at an, as yet, undiscovered time, and they form a council of elders. This production is facilitated by the Empress who publicly holds supreme power, but is possibly more a figure head.[Expand folder to read more[.
[The Talon are an astonishingly primitive society with little variation. They seem to have [abandoned all technological advancements - for some unknown reason.[ The Zirax impose a heavy toll upon the Talon  – zealously sheltering them with drones and other restraints. This may indicate either the Talon pose a threat to them… or are kept hostages for some unknown reason.[.

Planets are born by the swirling, scattered ashes - the legacy of dead, exploded stars. Gravity will collect all this messy debris, and give it a new form.

[Polaris Megacorp is a large multisystem corporation with reach that extends well beyond surveyed space. Most personnel is bipedal humanoid (metabolism seems to differ slightly from Terrans) but stems from any race in Andromeda, including the Zirax and the Kriel.[Fields of engagement[- Primary provider of materials, tech and devices for different 3rd party companies (Bertram, InterWeap, Servant.) [– Controls the majority of mining and refinery operations in surveyed space (UCH intel indicates a possible monopoly.) [– Relationship with Zirax unclear. Zirax installation infiltration suggests deep involvement with the empire, but this fact has yet to be confirmed. [- Same seems to be true for the Kriel Empire.[Other notes[The Polaris Megacorp has two subsidiaries: Polaris Space Industries (PSI) and Polaris Mining Company (PMC).[The Polaris Megacorp does not seem to be part of the much larger Traders Guild, but they both have tight relationships as spies report.[.
The KRIEL Empire is a growing superpower in Andromeda. The Kriel have seriously challenged the Zirax, as they both fight for the supremacy in this sector of Andromeda.Spies report, that the Kriel are organized like a bee hive, where the individual being is absolutely fungible on the one hand, but feeds the superorganism with valuable data at the same time. [The Kriel technical capabilities are on the same level with the Zirax Empire.[Origins[The Kriel seem to have evolved from insect-like creatures over millions of years on a planet that would be deadly to humans. In the last 10000 years they started getting more intelligent. It is believed they communicate via a hive mind and because of this are brutally efficient as they work as one. Despite the intelligence they have, they appear to have no emotion, including fear, and simply follow their instincts of conquering any other species they encounter, always in a quest for more resources expanding their colony. [Most Kriel emplacements are found on inhabited, barren worlds - a result from the Kriel having stripped those worlds from all of their resources. Single Kriel stations found on lush temperate planets or other resource rich environments only mean that this planet is going to be 'harvested' soon..
The Traders Guild is a millenia old congregation of traders and merchants. They dominate most of the trading and markets in this sector of Andromeda. They are neutral to all other factions, even Zirax and Kriel.[The Traders Guild seem to have tight relationships with the Polaris Megacorp, although the latter is not part of the organization as it seems..
For the most part, the pirates do whatever pirates have done in other eras and places. Their crews stem from all species in Andromeda, including Zirax and Kriel.[The Pirates faction is split into several sub-groups and clans. There is no official command structure, but most of the clans follow the lead of a secret council..
The Talon and Zirax seem to fear that name. No other information given yet..

It is not entirely clear what the VOID are. They resemble black monoliths floating on planets without showing any interaction with their surroundings. They seem to be related to the TESCH and the PROGENITOR..
The TESCH are no biological beings. They are basically AIs that are bound to certain structures, like datacenters. This fully digital lifeform is organized in semi-autark Nodes and Stations throughout their enormous territory closer to the center of the galaxy. Not a lot is known about its origin. They seem to be linked to the 'Progenitors' in some way and they have not shown a lot of interest in communications with the biologicals - except some trading for rare resources once and a while..
The Free Colonists are a mixed group of adventurers, explorers, runaways and other people that seek freedom or a new home outside of any faction controlled space for any imaginable reason or following the 'Galactic Colonization program', lead by Polaris Megacorp and the Traders Guild.[GCP and New Eden[Reports indicate, the 'Galactic Colonization program', which started about 200-300 years ago and is still actively supported by Polaris Megacorp and the Traders Guild not out of  pure philanthropic thoughts, but to open new markets and build up a counterpart to the  increasingly controlled and regulated Zirax space. The program leaders claim that a major part of the galaxy is already colonized due to their efforts.[The UCH scientific administration strongly recommends taking advantage of this program, internally referred to as 'New Eden'..

A small planetary patrol drone that has the capability to stun/disable biological beings and do a lot of damage to energy shields. It does no damage to armor and only has weak armor. The drone series was a concept of an energy-based non-lethal patrol drone, but development has ceased in favor of improved high-caliber projectile weaponry for drones and fighters..
The miniguns of this planetary drone are a real danger for all ground troops, but not so much for armored vessels. Its armor is quite weak..
The 30mm projectiles of this planetary drone will do a lot of damage to light armored, slow moving vessels, but only minor to zero damage to shields. It is also slightly better armored than the minigun drones. Ground troops are in a real danger as well, although the rate of fire is low enough to be able to possibly outrun the drone..
The (non-guided) rockets of this planetary drone deal a lot of piercing and splash damage including a small EMP effect component. They are a real danger for medium armored vessels, although shields will take only a fraction of the damage per rocket. Ground troops should be able evade the rockets if the distance is high enough and when moving quickly enough. The rocket drones have light to medium armor..
The minigun gunship class is geared to combat entire groups of hostile ground troops at the same time. It still uses the 15mm rounds, but due to modifications to the guns, it might deal some damage to smaller, unshielded vessels as well..
The rocket gunship is heavily armed and uses a slightly larger rocket type than its smaller sibling. The damage to shields and armor plates has been further increased by weapon modifications and a higher rate of fire..

The Kiuvera-class cutter is a state-of-the-art multi-role attack craft designed in the last few years after the Zirax encountered the UCH from studying the wreckage left from the battle over Akua.[Unlike older model zirax crafts, the cockpit is further forward with a wide wing-like fore instead of a heavily armored prow that would typically be used for ramming. The wing-like front stabilizes the craft and reduces strain on the ship's frame while entering atmosphere instead of simply forcing atmosphere out of the way with brute force.[The secondary purpose of the downward-curved wings is to function as supports as a dropship, capable of lifting ground vehicles and supplies long distance in-atmo for minimal fuel.[Unlike the Korat, the Kiuvera has interchangeable equipment, being easily refitted on the fly for patrol, bombing, surveillance and cargo. Making it a preferred patrol vessel for many of the zirax houses.[Attack value: [Defense value: [Weapons: 4x Laser[Shield:[Drones:.
The poor armaments and expensive hulls of the existing planetary patrol vessels made them ideal targets, to the point that it was considered arming the enemy by keeping them in service. The Korat-class cutter was put into service as a replacement.[Bordering on the boundary of being classed as a small vessel, Cutter-class ships have always been lightly armored, powered and armed. Improvements over the last few years during the construction of the zirax's new fleet elements saw marked improvements to their cutters to replace their planetary patrol vessels that until recently had been nothing more than armed freighters.[The Korat, like all cutters is a low-cost, mass-produced support craft designed for planetary patrol and survey missions. It's an agile craft equipped with a pair of underside Miniguns for anti-personnel ground combat and a pair of topside cannons for anti-aircraft combat.[Unlike the armed freighters it replaced, the Korat isn't warp-capable instead relying on a Tender to transport Cutters in-bulk between sectors. With the tenders mounting up to 8 cutters each, they're primarily used for anti-piracy action for pursuing smaller, agile enemies to ground. A fact that doesn't change when used alone to protect zirax assets on the ground or assist in a ground assault on an enemy installation.[Attack value: [Defense value: [Weapons: 2x Minigun, 2x Cannon[Shield: no[Drones:.
With the Zirax being a militaristic and aggressive race, they often design their ships for ramming, giving them an armored prow with a large engines at each end to provide thrust.[The main bridge is located at the end of the tail, rather than up high, center-mounted or at the front like a terran or polaran ship. Allowing the captain a view of the entire ship and clear visuals for clearance when landing such a wide vessel.[In heavy combat, the captain will usually switch to the Combat bridge at the heart of the ship where there's less chance of being killed by a stray rocket from a flanking spacecraft. Though taking the combat bridge for light combat is considered cowardly.[The main bridge can be sealed and ejected as a lifeboat in an emergency; includes cryopods for the entire crew.[Attack value: [Defense value: [Weapons: 4c Pulse Laser, 3x Plasma, 1x Minigun, 1x Flak[Shield:[Drones:.
The Periat-class Missile Frigate is the last of the older model hammerhead-type ships used by the Xenu.[Like the Sunat-class, the Periat possesses a heavily armored prow designed for head-on assaults and ramming. With a rear-mounted bridge to both survey the battlefield and to aid in landing the ship's considerable width, while also a lower, more protected combat bridge inside the head of the ship for heavy combat situations where the rear bridge may come under fire by a flanking enemy.[The ship boasts a considerable number of rooms and bunks for crew, but on average as the number of Periat-class frigates are slowly retired from service, less than half the available bunks are ever filled as crews are more use trained for more modern combat vessels.[Due to the considerable width of the Periat-class Frigates, docking and finding suitable landing areas always proved a problem and became one of the leading reasons the hammerhead-type ships went out of style. Relegated to the task of patrol duty, parade and support roles, they number now only in the hundreds.[The Periat-class have a hangar beneath the combat bridge, accessed from the rear; four forward-facing rocket batteries mounted top and bottom to engage enemies ahead, with four flak turrets mounted top and bottom to cover the rear and blind spots of the forward rocket batteries. A pair of heavy Zirax plasma turrets are mounted beneath the bridge to prevent boarders entering the hangar and for orbital bombardment of ground installations.[Attack value: [Defense value: [Weapons: 4x Rocket, 2x Plasma, 4x Flak, 4 Sentry[Shield:[Drones:.
The Imerat-Class Destroyer is one of the latest models of combat vessels currently in use by the Zirax, making up a significant portion of their total fleet. However, due to the need for defense around their home systems and border patrols at the edge of controlled space, it's generally quite rare to encounter one in the area between the two zones.[Unlike the older model Periat and Sunat class ships, the Imerat consolidates the majority of its infrastructure into a single, heavily armored body instead of spreading it out amongst an array of modules and arms. Giving away space normally used for crew for the mass of machinery required to run the engines and a high-output nuclear reactor far in excess of what the ship needs to run.[The general theory behind the use of such a high output generator is as an external power supply for establishing bases in the field; with the reactor connecting directly the bases infrastructure since it's more efficient to run the reactor constantly than to shut it down when not needed.[The Imerat's arsenal seems impressive on paper, but much of it is low-output energy weapons designed for combating legacy infestations and swarmships. While it has significant artillery, it's distributed for forward firing and orbital bombardment and isn't suitable for high-speed engagements, being at a disadvantage against a single small, fast-moving craft. For this reason, it has a set of rails on the rear to which a pair of fighters are usually docked to protect the ship's vulnerable rear.[Attack value: [Defense value: [Weapons: 8x Pulse Laser, 1x Rocket, 2x Flak, 3x Plasma, 3x Artillery, 7x Sentry[Shield:[Drones:.
The primary carrier unit of the zirax fleets, the Kamirat-Class Battlecarrier is a heavily armed and armored ship almost as dangerous alone as the Imerat-Class Destroyer, and just as important to the zirax navy.[Their deployment of largely unmanned drones allows them to strike fast and hard at multiple targets either offensively or defensively that costs less than a destroyer to operate in the face of the zirax empire's disproportionate population and dependency on cloning for shock troops.[Attack value: [Defense value: [Weapons: 12x Rocket, 15x Plasma, 12x Pulse Laser, 4x Artillery, 13x Sentry[Shield:[Drones:.
Among the zirax warfleet, the Tovera-Class is the only true battleship constructed since the war of silence. Designed to crack open legacy decimators, the Tovera's broad, hammer-head design, a typical design of zirax older vessels, allows it to direct all its considerable firepower onto a single point while simultaneously allowing to a full field of view, allowing it to fight on any angle.[Defensively, it has the thickest armor of any zirax ship ever built. With the prow of the ship being up to 15 meters thick, allowing the Tovera the resilience to withstand a direct impact with an Infector's reinforced shell with the infector coming out worse off.[With the resurgence of the Legacy, Rados shipyards have been working flat out to produce more Dreadnoughts, with the current count of Dreadnoughts in active service being estimated at 68. Most of which are concentrated around the zirax homeworld.[Attack value: [Defense value: [Weapons: 113 Turrets (!)[Shield:[Drones:.
The bomber gunship is often used in base attacks. It moves slower than the other gunships, but is heavily armed. Its bombs deal enormous damage to any ground troop and to armored structures, but only do little damage to shields..

Skenya Y Class (Destroyer).
A planetary fighter drone, merely built around the concept of a downsized, less armored and slower model of the Polaris space fighter. It is equipped with a MKII Pulsed Laser Repeater (PLR). It is a lot more costly to use and maintain when used on planetary drones compared to other purely projectile or other specialized energy based weapons. It's advantage: it is much more effective against armored targets compared to the standard pulse laser or a high caliber cannon, with a decent damage effect against shields. It is also deadly for ground troops as it has a higher rate of fire than the larger caliber guns..
The Polaris space combat fighters are equipped with a slightly modified version of the standard pulse laser weapon most fighters are using in this galaxy. Its increased damage on armor and higher damage on shields is accompanied by a heavier armor plating compared to its Zirax counterpart..
Scientists of the Polaris Megacorp have managed to create a heavily ionized pulsed laser particle that can severely damage shields and armor from a high distance. Drones equipped with these 'Laser Pulse Bolt' weapons are often used as long range attack craft together with Polaris laser fighters. The particle can melt through heavy plating, but is primarily known for being able to swipe away standard shields in seconds. The Pulse fighters are well armored, but due to the energy required for supercharging the ionized laser particle, they can only move slowly..
The Polaris Armed Shuttle, also known as the Surveyor is a short-range armed shuttle for collecting and depositing polaris workers, private security and equipment into or through hostile territory.[A reliable ship, it technically violates zirax law being larger than a commercial transport and more heavily armed than most drones.[Despite obvious signs of militarization, the innocently-named APC has many rows of seats to enforce its registration as a non-combat vessel and officially the weapons are intended for dealing with wildlife on the ground.[Despite being registered as a commercial transport for hazardous conditions, the Idala has a warship class designation and is unofficially classed as a Cutter, a small combat ship.[Nonetheless, it does serve publicly as a transport for workers too and from their residence modules to their designated workplace.[The first encounter with Polaris by the UCH was a regular transport crossing near the UCH defensive lines in the battle of Endeda Beta. Identified as a transport and with its identifiable coloring, it was given the temporary military designation of ""Schoolbus"", which after establishing closer relations with Polaris has unfortunately stuck with the rank and file. Much to the chagrin of the military command.[Attack value: [Defense value: [Weapon types: Pulse Laser, Flak[Shield:[Drones:.
The Kellend class vessels are sometimes used as an armed transport shuttle for the Polaris C-suit officials, but they're primarily in charge of any patrol, boarding- and landing operations.[Kellend class vessels will not stand a chance in a serious battle, but they are tough enough for clearing an ambush of pirates or keep up with occasional marauder encounters.

The Polaris Tenders are a combination of factory ship, giga transport and carrier platform.[There are only a few of those megaships, but each one is in the size of other factions carriers and beyond, capable of even supporting large Zirax Cruisers, running a full fledge mining operation…or building up a colony on its own![The ship class offers several fully automated ore-to-device production lines, repair and refilling facilities and an enormous amount of cargo capacity. They can hold a fleet of smaller ships for remote repair, supply and material transport and mining.[Because of that, tenders of the Illmarien-Class are often found, leading bigger mining and salvaging operations as mobile command outposts.[As these ships are incredibly slow and only have a few turrets for asteroid defense, they usually have a large escort group.[Attack value: [Defense value: [Weapon types: [Shield:[Drones:.
The plasma pulse drone used by the Traders Guild for planetary sector control is equipped with a fast firing plasma pulse weapon which deals a lot of damage to armor and shields. The drone itself is using a chassis of the Zirax planetary small drones, but with weaker armor due to the planetary drone can move quite fast and has a high maneuverability, but it can literally be damaged by throwing a stone at it - as their operators often complain..
The plasma space fighter is equipped with a larger version of its planetary siblings weapon. Due to the larger chassis, the energy management is less of a problem. The energy content and thus the damage of the plasma pulses on impact are a lot higher. The fighter moves fast and is highly maneuverable.
The plasma rocket fighter bomber is based on the same chassis that all of the Traders Guild fighters are using. It is bearing a self-guided, slow moving plasma warhead. The impact will severely damage the target's armor and shields, although there is a chance to outrun the projectile for vessels. Due to the heavier armoring and the max speed for the rocket deployment, the fighter bomber is flying slower than a pulse fighter and also needs to be quite close to its target to be able to release the warhead..
The artillery support vessel is based on the same chassis as the Zirax heavy Interceptor series. It moves slower than the Interceptor and has only basic armor, but is equipped with a special rocket, bearing a fusion warhead, which works both against shields and all kinds of armor.  Although the projectiles are quite costly and the vessels are lost quite often due to their basic armor, the Zirax Strategic Command insists to keep this vessel in the main combat groups..

The cannon drone is based on stolen or captured Polaris drones. Instead of the Pulse Lasers, they are equipped with modified high caliber cannons of unknown origin. The cannons are dangerous for un-shielded medium armored vessels, but only have a low effect on shields. The drones armor is lower than its original version, but it moves faster..
Based on stolen/captured versions of the Zirax Rocket Gunship. The pirates have managed to squeeze in several batteries of mortar launchers of unknown origin. The rockets do slight damage to standard shields and do some damage to medium armor. The drone moves as slow as the gunship it is based on and has reduced armor due to the modifications made. Its main task is to fight light to medium ground vessels and infantry..
Based on the chassis of a stolen/captured Traders Guild Plasma fighter. It is equipped with an EMP weapon, based on a stolen (discontinued) prototype concept the Zirax Empire was working on for their space fighters. Its effect on shields is only slightly lower than its Polaris equivalent, but its rate of fire is increased, which makes it more dangerous for vessels that rely on shields. The downside of the prototype concept: it does no damage to medium or heavy armor and only little to standard armor. The armor of the fighter is low as well.[It is often used to 'strip down' shields of vessels to prepare the boarding operations or make artillery support more efficient. [The nickname the operator crews use for this vessel internally is a lot more .. colloquial.[.
The Rocket Ferry is a combination of a stolen/captured chassis of the Polaris Fighter, stuffed with self-guided long range swarm rockets of unknown origin. It can deal a lot of damage, also to standard shields, but it moves only at an average speed, although due to its long range weapon, it can attack from quite a distance.[It is often used together with the Stripper..
The pirate clans have developed a few own models for fighters and drones, often based on stolen chassis, equipped with weapons of unknown origin, but it is also possible to run into drones, fighters and even small and large vessels that the pirate clans have captured from other factions. [Besides the taunting element and using them simply for their often greatly superior firepower, compared to the corvettes and frigates the Pirate Clans are using, it has become a habit to use these ships to either set up ambushes or fooling the patrol ships for an easy escape after a heist..

The Legacy SEEKER drones are used on planets and in space. They are equipped with an antiproton beam, which deals a lot of damage to even strong shields and melts into the hardest armor like a hot knife in butter.[It is said, that in the War of Silence, the appearance of a single SEEKER drone at the outskirts of a solar system gave everyone only a few minutes to either escape or prepare for a likely to be lost LEGACY assault..
During the War of Silence, the Infector was the Legacy's vanguard in every direct engagement. Acting as both warship and frontline base for the spread of the Legacy onto protectorate planets the Infectors could cut a swathe through frigates and destroyers defending a planet before dropping from orbit like a meteorite onto densely populated areas.[Once landed, the Infectors would extend tendrils into the ground and begin spreading both viral and mutagenic compounds into the environment to modify those left injured, dying or dead from the impact.[Hundreds of cycles since the war, the scars and effects left by the Infectors can still be seen and in many cases have become a source of raw materials and rare isotopes used in everything from medicine and weapons to warp drive components and fuel. These irradiated zones still produce mutated creatures born from the Legacy Virus, but without the connection or intelligence that made them the efficient killing machines they were.[The Infector, or ""Nautilus"" consists of a segmented circular shell of significant strength and thickness that protects the equally rigid mechanics of the interior. The shell's thickness is required for the entity to survive the impact from orbit which many still failed to do after being damaged by defending ships.[While the body of the entity possesses no defensive armaments, a pair of defense rings float an exact distance from the eye of the nautilus' shell providing a full sphere of coverage with powerful Anti-Proton beam emitters.[Attack Value: [Defense Value: [Weapon Type: Anti-Proton beam[Shield:[Drones:.

With the entity damaged beyond recovery 60% of the time.) they were typically found as a rear guard for the Infectors in planetary assaults or as protection for Hiveships.[An Infector-class biocraft that has successfully landed and absorbed natural materials, will in many cases transition into a Decimator, rise into orbit and assume the task of supporting invasion with new infectors on another location.

[ There is one important premise for the default game: In case an admin-core station can shoot at you, turrets and relevant devices can always be destroyed. A station with an admin core which does NOT shoot at you (and which is NOT a Trading Station), is either a Dungeon or a Story-relevant POI.  But: Most of the time there is still a method for the core to be destroyed by the player. For example a lever or a puzzle or a riddle that will blast the core when solved. Without  a core, all the blocks and devices are destructible again!.

Technical max speed = relates to rendering, collision and other game parameters. This is the absolute max speed that you cannot go over by any  means (if you can, it is possibly not intentional and a bug [TECHNICAL max speed should not be confused with the TOP SPEED of your vessel. The latter can be much lower than the technical max speed. See chapter about VIRTUAL DRAG in the FLIGHT MODEL entry for more info.[Note: The given values for the technical max speeds are those that ""work"" with the game and create the least of issues. [.
Most of the thrusters now offer the capability to BOOST the ship speed for a short amount of time.[Keycombo[LeftSHIFT + Directional Key [(For example SHIFT+W, +A, +S, +D )[The BOOSTERS will fire,  as LONG as you keep the key kombo pressed OR until the boost is consumed. Then it will take a while to load up again.[Boosting does not consume extra fuel or energy at the moment and it is also not visible by an extra effect on the thrusters, yet..
HUD Info / Loading.
The HUD is showing the load status with a circle below the MOVEMENT element on the right side of the HUD (see screenshot in the 1st post of this thread or in the HUD info  thread! [The BOOST will load up only when the vessel or the thrusters are On/powered..
The boost is available in ANY direction for which a boost-capable thruster is available. Said that, BOOST is not an ""afterburner"" tech, only accelerating the ship forward, but BOOST can also be used to the side, up or down or even backward, for example to come to a full stop faster. Given a boost-capable thruster is available for this direction, of course!.
Technical: max/top speed limit.
[  - The Boost will NOT bring you above the technical max speed or the top speed of the vessel (see explanation of VIRTUAL DRAG further below), but BOOST-ACCELERATE your vessel  towards the TOP SPEED of your vessel. Using Boost while you are already at TOP SPEED is only wasting your boost[  - [  - Boost, technically spoken, is a multiplier to the actual THRUST value of the thruster..
There are two possibilities to generate torque for a vessel[1. RCS devices (fixed output independent of placement)[2. Thrusters generate torque based on their position on the vessel and their thrust direction..
Thruster Torque - Calculation.
Other than for RCS devices, the calculation of thruster-torque depends on a lot of factors ( inertia tensor of the ship, the positions and orientations of all the thrusters of the ship compared its the center of mass, ..etc) BUT information about what amount of torque is contributed by RCS and/or Thrusters is available in the STATISTIC tab of the control panel.[Important NOTE: [The thrust-torque always generates in relation to the planes created by the different axis spread from the CENTER OF MASS, not anything else! [What means: [Thrusters generate rotation around the two axes perpendicular to the thruster direction, with a strength proportional to the thrusters' distance from the center of mass. Ships always rotate around their center of mass.[Example: [If your thrusters you use to produce a Yaw are not exactly in the horizontal plane containing the center of mass, then this will generate mostly a Yaw but also some small Pitch and some Small Roll. If the ship is not able to cancel those other unwanted rotations (here Pitch and Roll) with some other thrusters it will cancel the rotation and not turn..
Aerodynamics can be used to build plane-style vessels that work in atmospheres with only a back-facing thruster (and a forward facing for braking!)[The mechanic is pretty straight forward:[As long as the ground-facing surface of your vessel is large/big enough, it might create enough uplift to allow your vessel to be leveled with the horizon and NOT drop to the grown as you are moving forward fast enough. (This is NOT a full real-world simulation of course!)[If you vessel is heavy and you are going too slow and the shape is not really optimal (although you will not need a wing-only style vessel to make this work!!) you will not achieve the same performance and possibly drop to the ground..
[Tips[- Spreading out the thruster from the center of mass of the vessel will increase the torque![  - Depending in which direction the thruster points and where it is placed, it will add its torque to roll, yaw or pitch[  - Unlike the BOOST, torque will be added by ANY thruster (JET and Standard)[- You do NOT need an RCS to roll or pitch or yaw your vessel! (Also saves CPU points).
The VIRTUAL DRAG, although it will have a lot of impact on the TOP SPEED (not to confuse with the TECHNICAL max speed of the vessel class; see explanation above) of your vessel and depends a lot on how you shape your vessel, is the feature that possibly requires the least of explanations.[The system is very simple and can be put in between these two extremes:[  - If your vessel is build more like an arrow, you might be able to rise the TOP SPEED of your vessel up to the TECHNICAL MAX SPEED of your vessel type just by building and with only few thrusters.[  - If you build a flying brick, the TOP SPEED of your vessel might not even be close to the TECHNICAL MAX SPEED of your vessel type and you might need to reduce mass or increase thrust.[This accounts for ALL movement directions, as well as for roll/yaw/pitch![Virtual drag takes into account the overall shape of the vessel.[The Virtual Drag values are  visualized on the STATISTIC page or - together with the other flight mechanic values - on a dedicated, new Control Panel tab.
[Why is it called VIRTUAL DRAG?[Because it is NOT the physical (aerodynamic) drag alone, but a combination of a lot of factors. The term ""VIRTUAL DRAG"" is a hand term to describe the methods and factors used to define the TOP SPEED of your vessel (which might not necessarily range up to the technical max speed of the vessel type)![For example in space the single factor ""drag"", that you only have in an atmosphere, is of course not present, but other factors like mass and thruster capability are still weighted in.[Why is this also affecting ships in space?[The VIRTUAL DRAG to some extent compensates for the inevitable technical limitations of the game environment and engine. Also, as we do NOT want Empyrion to be a physics simulation, we cannot fully use real world physics and mechanics, for example thrust power, mass, volumes etc. [By limiting the technical max speed, we have to find a middle ground between technical possibilities and a gameplay that is fun but not too simplified. The VIRTUAL DRAG (As well as other features) add a new challenge in terms of an additional balancing parameter -  which can be overcomed either by building and design or by using CPU Points in terms of investing in thrust or RCS..

Most devices and blocks cost CPU points when added to a vessel or structure. To check the requirements of a device, have a look at its hover info card.[A structure/vessel has a limit of how many CPU points you can spend on its devices per CPU TIER. [You can increase the CPU points pool by installing CPU EXTENDERS, which increases your CPU TIER.[You can keep adding devices 'over CPU' even in case your CPU points on your actual CPU TIER are used up BUT this will reduce the overall CPU EFFICIENCY of some devices, like weapons, thrusters etc. What means you will fly slower, for example. [CPU Tiers are not a hard limit, though.[Check the STATISTICS page in the Control Panel for detailed info about CPU Tier levels, points and Efficiency![Knowledge:[- Maintaining the 100% CPU performance gives you some benefits, like increased thruster performance.[- Dropping below the 100% efficiency will increase penalties the same way, for example reduced generator output, down to a point where your base or vessel becomes fully dysfunctional![- CPU Extenders do not remove the requirement of a CORE![- To unlock a CPU Tier you need to place ALL Extenders of the TIER you want to use.[ - If you have one or several additional Tiers completed and you LOSE a device from the highest  (working) Tier-level (f.ex in combat), you drop back to the NEXT lower (completed) Tier[- Losing a CPU Tier will also remove the CPU Points available and thus possibly lower the Efficiency of your vessel[Tip: Having LOWER CPU tiers in your vessel or base will work as a FALLBACK. When a higher Tier is lost you do not drop to T1, but maybe only to the next lower tier (which means the Efficiency of your affected base or vessel is not decreased too much).
If your base is too close or even inside an enemy faction's territory, the chance is high that it will send troops to tear down your base. The more dangerous you are considered by a faction, the heavier the attack will hit.[You can check the threat level in the control panel of a base:[1. Open the control panel (P)[1. Go to the STATISTICS tab[2. Look at the BASE ATTACK info card on the lower right[The Base Attack info will tell you WHICH base from a certain faction is currently coordinating the attacks.[When this command center is destroyed, and given there are not multiple command centers, the attacks will end on this planet.[Knowledge:[A faction can have several command centers.

- When mining cooperatively it can happen in rare cases that, although you are connected to a Logistic Network, items might drop to the ground. This can happen as the storage-method cannot move items in  a container in the EXACT same second for several players. If the container is blocked in that very second, a picked up item might get dropped in front of you.[- There is currently a limit that the Network cannot relay beyond the grid size of 500m AND if you place a wireless network block in ""connected mode"" only the 1st WiFi Block within 100m from the edge of the base will relay the signals.

There are six distinct stages of faction reputation[- Hostile[- Unfriendly[- Neutral [- Friendly[- Honored[You can earn or lose Reputations which will improve or worsen your standing with those factions.[Some factions are not visible to you in the beginning. To discover them, find a station or ship of the faction.[Check ESC > Faction window for more information.[Note:[This NPC Factions system should NOT be confused with the Player-ORIGINS and the Player-Factions. Both are technically different systems, given you need fixed rules to define a standing, you also need to pre-set the factions as the game cannot work with factions it does have no infos about. What means: as Player-Origins and Player-Factions are dynamic, customizable and may or may not exist in the game or on a server and might have different ""relationships"" given on how the creator designs those, there is currently no real ""touchpoint"" between those two systems. As a player - or player-faction - you can not join any of the NPC Factions, for example..
Reputation Points & Actions.
Multiplayer NPC Faction interaction.
On the HUD in the upper right corner you can see the territory you are currently in - and the Standing towards this faction[On the lower right the info will pop up about Reputation Points gathered or lost[In the upper right message box you will get an info if your Standing changed towards this faction..
There are 6 dedicated standing levels which are tied to a defined Reputation Points threshold in a 6000-per level interval[0 - 6000 : Hostile[6001 - 12000 : Unfriendly[12001 - 18000: Neutral[18001 - 24000: Friendly[24001 - 30000: Honored[Example: If you see “Hostile: 5800/6000” you just slipped into “hostile” with 200 points.

Factions are not necessarily friends to each other - they might even be rivals. Given the Lore behind those factions, certain actions you as a player (or faction) do in favor or against a faction might lead to your faction standing towards another faction changes.[The faction rivalry info is available in the FACTION window when hovering over the faction entry.[Missions for a faction might rise or drop your faction standing as well..
First: as soon as you join a faction, your RP with a faction are calculated into the factions. There is not ""private"" standing vs. any NPC Faction anymore, only the factions standing vs. the NPC factions.[Example:[2 Players founding a faction.[Player A has a standing of 30.000 with Zirax (Honored)[Player B has a standing of 0 with Zirax (Hostile)[The Player-Faction that results will have a standing of (30.000+0)/2 = 15000[Player C is joining with a standing of 0 (Hostile)[The Player-Faction Standing will result in (15.000+15000+0)/3 = 7.500[Player D joining wit a standing of 30.000[The Player-Faction Standing will result in (30.000+7500+7500+7500)/4 = 13.125[Player A is then killing a Zirax[The Player Faction will drop to HOSTILE for all players[Player D now leaves the faction.[His private standing will then start again on the standing the faction had with the NPC Factions at this point. (You do not ""get back"" your initial private NPC Standing you might have had BEFORE joining the faction).
It does not interact at all. Scenario Creators CAN set up a NPC-Standing for players that join an ORIGIN. This is basically only the ""starting point"".[The player in an Origin does NOT collect or contribute to the standing of the Origin to any NPC Faction, as there is no mechanic Player Origin vs. NPC Factions yet..
Levels ( Structures / Creatures ).
When pointing at a structure, NPC or creature you will notice a number in front of its name or HP-bar. This is the level of the Creature or the level of the NPCs in that structure.[What effect does the level have?[The Level is basically a MULTIPLIER of its attack (Damage of his weapon) and defense (Hitpoint) values.  [The Level is an additional multiplier to your decision if you want to play the whole game on a certain difficulty level!.[Basic Multipliers for GAME Difficulty modes[  - EASY = 0.5[  - MEDIUM = 1[  - HARD = 2[Level multipliers for NPC/Creatures (0.1667-stepping)[  - Level 10 = 2.5[  - Level 9 = 2.33[  - Level 8 = 2.17[  - Level 7 = 2.00[  - Level 6 = 1.83[  - Level 5 = 1.67[  - Level 4 = 1.50[  - Level 3 = 1.33[  - Level 2 = 1.17[  - Level 1 = 1.00[Reads: If you played on MEDIUM before and now run into a Level 10 NPC on the same difficulty level, the NPC is 2.5x stronger than in Alpha 8.[How does this work?[Example 1: You start the game on EASY and run into an NPC with level 10.

Why no Hull Blocks?.
Hull blocks help to keep away damage from the interiors, like generators, fuel tanks etc. On the other hand, you cannot fly away without thrusters. So shielding the interior the best way possible might give you an edge in a battle, but the AMOUNT of Hullblocks does not give any clue if a lucky shot that went through a window is not just bad piloting skill. [Beyond that, sticking a lot of hull blocks into a large ship does not necessarily mean it is a strong ship, but just a well armored one. Acknowledging this might be a weak signal to be added to the calculation, for the time being we want to have the formula handle distinct values referring to a combat situation regarding the outcome of a ""technically comparable stalemate"" ..
The names COMBAT and INFANTRY are used in the loca/displaying areas use different internal ""working names"" and abbreviations:[  - [Combat = Artillery Attack Defense[ (AAD)[All the big guns and relevant devices that are usually on the outside of a ship or vessel, fighting other ships or vessels or bases = large scale ""artillery"" combat[  - [Infantry = Infantry Attack Defense[ (IAD)[Includes NPCs that spawn from a spawner plus Sentries (as they are not defined to combat vessels, but player/creatures/NPC.

The algorithm calculates the amount of sun-rays that will hit the solar panel for a certain placement during the day. [The placement affects their efficiency :[- This average efficiency is then displayed with the GREEN LCDs (up to four LED lights)[- The current efficiency is displayed by the YELLOW LED lights (up to four LED lights)[If solar panels produce more electricity than currently needed, the surplus energy is stored in the Capacitor (Solar) block like in a battery.[To display the surplus of energy (or the “energy reserve”), there is now a battery icon in the main page of Control Panel that shows the current content of the battery..

In case you turned your vessel upside down, use SHIFT to upright it..
For a HV you can go two ways.[1. Adding REPULSOR engines[Repulsors include thrust, torque and hovering in one device. They cannot go over water and they are slow. They are mostly suitable for small HVs like the ""Hoverbikes"" offered in the BP Library.[2. Adding HOVER ENGINES[You need at least 2-3 Hover Engines spread out evenly to stabilize the hover vessel. You can use SHIFT to increase and C to lower the hover height. You also need thrusters pointing back, forth, left and right.[Note: you can go with fewer thrusters or add RCS devices. See Thruster Torque for more info..
Small & Capital Vessels.
You need 6 thrusters, one pointing in each direction.[You need at least one RCS.[Note: You can use less thrusters in case you design for Aerodynamic lift and you can theoretically get rid of  RCS in case you spread your thrusters for getting most out of the thrusters-torque. Check the info chapters on that topic further below.[.
Note that, in case you are on a high-gravity planet or just loaded your vessel up to its maximum, the vessel might lack the thrust power to take off.[Check the STATISTICS page in the Control Panel for info if your thrust is high enough to escape the planet..
There are two types of detectors[- Handheld Detector[- Handheld Scanner[- Vessel-bases Detectors[Handheld Detector[Equip the Detector on your toolbar and perform scans with LMB periodically, to reveal POIs and underground-stone and voxel deposits within the Detector range.[Moving the crosshair on the scanned object within detection range (~300m for the handheld Detector) will reveal more info.[Handheld Ore Scanner (Passive)[Only works when carried either in inventory or toolbar.

Each item and device has a mass and a volume.[Volume[Containers usually have a limit on volume. Build more or use the Container Controller system explained below to work around this limitation. For your suit, there are SUIT BOOSTERS available that can extend the volume limit.  You can also work around that limitation with the LOGISTICS NETWORK![Mass[Mass primarily affects the flying behavior of vessels. You might lose the vessel's capability to take off from a planet (check STATISTICS page in the Control Panel) or you are going a lot slower than you could in case you overload your vessel.  Docked vessels also count towards the mass of the carrier. For players the mass currently has no penalty..

Stones on the ground. All the different resources available as surface rocks have specific colors or models. They can be mined manually and with vessels.[There is no tool to discover them. You need to spot them with your eyes..
For underground deposits there are two variants:[a) underground (voxel) deposits that resemble a vein of ore you can mine[b)  sub-surface ore rocks (SSOR) as groups of rocks placed underground.  [For SSOR you might need an ORE SCANNER in your inventory to reveal their position, as the DETECTORS only reveal the position of the deposit itself (center point on terrain) but not the individual ore rocks (which might not happen to be located in the center area!).
On most planets, meteorites will rain from the sky, either per default or when a particular ore deposit is depleted. A meteoroid warning is issued to your screen. Check the map (M) to spot where it has landed.[Note: Resource meteoroids are not to be confused with weather phenomena like 'meteor rain'. The latter is not bearing any resources..
Resource Asteroids are found floating in space, either in planet orbits or in sectors of the solar system, for example in asteroid fields.[Resource Asteroids can be detected with a detector device. [Resource Asteroids are always voxel deposits.[You cannot place Autominers on them..

[Note:[For vessel-based mining make sure you have your vessel equipped with a 'Container Controller (Ore and Wood)' and an appropriate amount of 'Container Extensions' to hold the ores - otherwise the drilled materials will drop on the ground or float away into deep space..
Autominers can be placed on SSOR and voxel deposits. They need to be powered and you need to pick up the ores from their internal containers.  [Tip: Use the connected toolbar for transferring large quantities of heavy/voluminous ores to a nearby vessel..

A sector encompasses not only the planet and its immediate orbit, but can also host (several) moons.  The space sectors are about 200x200x200km in size. Measured in meter/miles.[Note: Currently you cannot fly directly from one sector into an adjacent sector. You need to have a warp-capable vessel..
Solar systems always have a sun .. even if it is a black hole.[A solar system can host planets, gas giants, asteroid fields and stations. A solar system can also be empty, though.[The distance in a solar system is measured in AU (Astronomical Units)..
The galaxy encompasses all the solar systems. Sometimes galaxies can have smaller satellite galaxies. You might need specific equipment to get there.[Distances between solar systems are measured in LY (Light Years)..
For intrasolar warping between sectors, you need at least a Small Vessel with a warpdrive and a warpdrive tank. You need to fill the warpdrive tank with refined pentaxid .. which can be harvested from crystals or found in deposits (often to be found on moons and on asteroids).

For intergalactic travel between solar systems, you need a capital vessel with a warpdrive (T1) and a warpdrive tank.  Pentaxid is required as fuel as well..
Each layer has its own map. Hit M to access it. Use the buttons on the top row to switch to the SECTOR or GALAXY level.[Note: each map has an INFO button. Click to learn more about the map you are currently using..
For warping, select a sector or a solar system and use LOCK TARGET or click on your destination with CTRL + Left Mouse Button.  [This adds an orange rectangle to your pilot screen. [Point the crosshair towards it (you do not need to aim at it 100% exactly!) and accelerate to at least 30m/s.  Hit K to warp.[Shields need to be switched off ( X button)[Note: Bookmarks can also work as WARP destinations![Example: A bookmark in the orbit of Planet A shows up in your HUD when it is in the same system. Simply point towards the yellow marker and warp (You do not need to set a warp destination in that case!).
On the planetary and orbital map, you can also set other markers that can be used as bookmarks.[Left-Click on a position will bring up a menu. Make the appropriate selections (f.ex. remove on approach) and a YELLOW marker will be added to the map, your radar and your (pilot) hud.[Note: [- Markers can be seen BEYOND the playfield they are in! (For example the marker for a base on the planet can be seen from the orbit)[- The REGISTRY is keeping track of all of your markers as well![- You can share bookmarks with your friends in MP..
You cannot warp when you are shot at (20s cooldown).[You cannot warp when shields are active (Use X to switch off).
Q: What do I need to do to stop the vessel?[A: Destroy the Thrusters[Q: Will this set off an automated despawn timer?[A: Yes. (Timer follows the settings in the playfield.yaml and thus can vary, f.ex. 200-250 seconds)[Q: Can I board and loot (the containers of) the vessel?[A: Yes.[Q: Can I salvage/multitool the vessel when I stopped it?[A: Yes.  The OPVs roaming will not self-destruct when removing their core.[Q: Can I control / capture the vessel[A: Currently not.[Q: Is there a way to modify the parameters like despawn, respawn etc?[A: Check  \Empyrion - Galactic Survival\Content\Playfields\+ExampleSpace\space_dynamic.yaml AND ..\Empyrion - Galactic Survival\Content\Playfields\SpaceOrbit\space_dynamic.yaml for examples on how to adjust and set up OPVs.[A: You cannot deactivate the de-coring destruction sequence.
Space Base Defense vessels.
[This applies to Orbital Patrol Vessels (OPVs) spawned by the Space Base Defense (SBD) reinforcements mechanism as soon as a POI calls for help.[Q: What do I need to do to stop the vessel?[A: Destroy the Thrusters[Q: Will this set off an automated despawn timer?[A: Depends. There are a few options.[- If the ship can still move, but only has lost a lot of weapons, it will try to warp out (if it has a warp drive)[- If the ship is not able to move and lost all weapons it will start the self destruction[- If the vessel is not able to move, but still has some weapons, it will remain a wreck until s.o. removes the core or with playfield-clear up despawn.[Q: Can I board and loot (the containers of) the vessel?[A: Yes.[Q: Can I salvage/multitool the vessel when I stopped it?[A: No, because for salvaging (removing parts with the Multitool) you need to de-core it, which will set off the destruction sequence and despawn the vessel, which works as follows: Core removed > 30 Second silent countdown until explosion sequence > after another 60 seconds, the ship will despawn.[Q: Can I control / capture the vessel[A: Currently not.[Q: Is there a way to modify the parameters like despawn, respawn etc?[A: No. There are settings for the SBD available in ..\Empyrion - Galactic Survival\Content\Configuration\FactionWarfare.ecf  BUT you cannot deactivate the de-coring destruction sequence.

With 'Credibility Seals', earned by running certain missions for certain factions, you can restore your reputation from Hostile to Neutral.[How does it work?[1. Find a Global Information Network (GIN) console in one of the trading stations (planet or orbit).[2. Access the console and contact an ambassador of any faction and use your earned credibility seals to improve your standing. [Notes:[- For each step from hostile to unfriendly and unfriendly to neutral, one seal is consumed. [- You cannot improve your reputation with the faction beyond neutral with the faction credibility seals, though. - You can earn seals by completing credibility missions. Some story missions and quests (if available for this faction) offer them as well.[IMPORTANT: You need to have the seals in your inventory to successfully complete your request!.

The Operation Phoenix Fleet dropped out of hyperspace in an unknown solar system on July 26, 2473, and was immediately attacked by Zirax forces. The transporter UCH Heidelberg was shot down, but there were several survivors. A few of them left messages for the player to find in certain places. Those messages should give him a first idea about what happened to the fleet and where to start searching for survivors.[While examining the crashed vessel, you find indications that you did not arrive WITH the fleet, but lost 1 year for some unknown warp-drive-jump-gone-wrong reasons while you were dragged into the warp-vortex of the TITAN and the Operation Phoenix fleet. [You are actually in the year 2474.[This chapters logs and messages are setting up the basic storyline for all UCH-related missions.[.
The TITAN - Background Info.
The TITAN has been the flagship of the Operation Phoenix Fleet. Together with its sister ship, the UCH GRAND, it led the voyage into the unknown. Instead of arriving in Proxima Centauri (Milkyway) the fleet was dragged to Andromeda, caused by the Waverider Protocol initiating an irregular warp jump. After their arrival, the TITAN was destroyed in the initial battle that followed when the fleet left hyperspace. Its remains are to be found on the Moon of the starter system.[The TITAN wreckage on the moon had several messages secretly saved for you to be found later. Why Commander Mercer (Senior) did this, is not clear, but the logs shed light on the events that lead to the alleged failure of Operation Phoenix up to the point where the player was dragged into the warp vortex of the TITAN..
You are making your first contact with the GLaD organization. Your first mission: search for a lost vessel of the Polaris Megacorp, the Ilmarinen.[The Ilmarinen is a long-range exploration and mining vessel of the Kullervo Class. It was sent to deep space and returned infected by the LEGACY. The logs reveal what has happened and indicate that the Polaris Megacorp might have unintentionally reactivated the LEGACY threat that slept for nearly a millennium..
Ilmarinen Exploration Crew [2nd Commander Fract'alite. [===[THIS IS a WARNING to the pilot approaching this station! Hold your distance, pick up this message and relay it to the Polaris HQ! The Ilmarinen is heading for this planet, but it is not under our control![To anyone who is reading this: Code Omega! DESTROY that whole ship! [We picked something up, which killed the entire crew and took control of the ship. We managed to survive long enough to find this station and send this recorded warning, but no doubt we are already dead. Do not search for survivors.[I repeat: DESTROY that ship and this station as well with the strongest weapons you have! Do NOT leave even dust! [I am so sorry. Chief SaintJohn was absolutely right from the beginning. [We might have revived the dark times. [May the galaxy forgive us ...
[Mission day 500[Log entry 197 [===[We have found something! 500 days searching for habitable worlds. 500 days without any success. We found a lot of resources, sure. But the captain said, we cannot deviate from our mission. The mining crews will take it easy while we head to the next star. At least we have found something interesting today. A burnt-out world near a red dwarf. The captain has allowed me to join the expedition! This will feel like a holiday after 499 days staring at the sensor logs and cataloging broken doors. [I am quite excited!.
[Mission day 501[Log entry 202[===[Official Complaint![ I am adding this to the ship's log, so no one will complain if Hangar 4 needs to be overhauled. These science guys could not leave this, this ... thing ...  on the planet! @w2 Since we need to hurry to the next damn star, they simply brought it aboard the ship! [There is enough room, the captain said. Sure. But I'm the one that'll need to explain the damages, scratches and strange melted traces in the hangar. If it was me, we'd have left it where it was. [Damn science kids..
[Mission day 503[Log entry 280 [===[Message to the Captain.[This mess happening in Hangar 4 is getting out of control, Frank! The wreckage has lost ... weight ... and even mass, which seems crazy. Spilling some substance all over the floor. We have sealed the doors, but I doubt this will keep this slippery stuff inside. As our lead scientist told me, the wreckage they picked up was covered in a biological substance, which seems to moulder due to the changed atmospheric parameters. Really great. [Can you guys guess who's getting assigned to the cleaning squad?.
[Mission day 514[Log entry 382 [===[Personal Note 32[What did they bring on board? These idiots! This wasn't some sort of biological remamins, melting from the ship. No, the ship ITSELF is transforming into a semi-liquid state! And if that wasn't enough, the substance is growing on every surface like a ... mushroom. Sending out spores that  hopefully - now are being removed from the air ducts again. [We might possibly have to cut off this entire section from the ship to prevent this getting out of hand!.
[Mission day 520[Log entry 420 [===[Official ship log entry, interim captain of the Ilmarinen, C. SaintJohn. [The captain and the 2nd Commander have been sent to the medbay. As well as a third of the crew. The spores have led to some serious infections. We've sent a message to the HQ that all ships are not to make contact with any of these wreckages, which we now refer to as 'Infectors'. This seems to be what they do. [The report and a warning was sent a day ago. Until help arrives it might take a while. I am afraid we have to seal large parts of the ship and flood the areas with decontamination fluids..
Mission day 550[Log entry 480 [===[Who cares.. [The crew is lost. Or transformed. Or how would you call it? We've lost main control of the ship. My crew and I at least managed to prevent the alien organisms taking full control, but we could not prevent the ship from moving back to Ellyon. For whatever reason it wants to go there. [We have damaged the engines, but I am afraid this ... substance ... is able to repair them over time. We did not manage to activate the self-destruct. So I am putting this as a warning for anyone reading this. Get out of here as quick as you can and blast this ship into pieces. It is on you to stop this plaque from spreading to inhabited worlds!.
Let me think. It happened a few months ago. [A few strangers with uniforms like yours came to the club and ran into some of those always drunken Zirax troopers. Zirax Empire. Bah. Scourge of Andromeda. Always trying to blackmail the people here. [Then your people came in, asking for something, noticed the Zirax and then things.. got crazy. HaaHaa.. [They have beaten those Zirax out of the club. Literally. We had to redecorate the main hall .. but hey.. what a show! [Now we have our own security personnel here. Bad for some.. customers. But hey..[ Anything else maybe?[Hm. Not much, I am afraid. One of yours was called.. hmmmmm.. was something with Al.. Alf.. Axl? Not sure to be honest.[Alex?[Yes! That was the name! Wait! They talked about a remote planet and a ship waiting somewhere for someone..
The investigations about the LEGACY are leading up to the final mission of the first story part: The Polaris Megacorp found a strange, millenia-old artifact in one of the asteroid mining stations and asked the UCH to carefully investigate the matter. The UCH issued a mission to the GLaD to take care of that. The player is approached by GLaD Sectioner32, to secure the staff and find out more.[The player infiltrates the Polaris mining station, which is under control of the Zirax empire and manages to find and identify the artifact as the STAFF of GUIDANCE. Afterwards, the player finds Mahan station, which was once part of an ancient archive planet. The player learns some valuable info about the Zirax, Talon and their Talon-Zirax Assembly, both from the Station AI and from three info blocks placed in the AI room.[This mission also gives some hints about GLaD being at least in some relation to the UCH and Sectioner32 possibly being his companion Alex..
Something in the cargo we were carrying has breached containment and has been affecting both the ship and the crew. It started as nothing more than a few headaches but before long it had spread to the entire crew. Slowly they became delusional and had to be locked in their quarters before they became violent. [Whatever it was in that cargo we were carrying, it's been hard at work while we've been trying to contain the crew. Slowly but surely it consumed and disabled the cargo sensors and began corrupting the hull of the ship unnoticed... at least until I looked out the window and saw growths on the exterior of unit 5. I had to...@w5 order cargo purges on the remaining units that I could still access. I'm about to initiate a complete lockdown of all systems and shut all emergency bulkheads and blast doors before I... [I... i've slaved the controls away from the ship's AI... to a lever here on the bridge... I've put some of the security turrets in here to keep those things...those things... away from the controls. I... think i'll take a little walk... outside.[It looks like it'll be a lovely day outside....
You learn more about the events  after the arrival of the Operation Phoenix fleet and how the GLaD was founded, as well as confirms that Alex Lamarr actually was Sectioner32 and that she is even a founder of GLaD organisation - which split from the UCH based on some disagreements, but is now working with them unofficially again..
On his first official mission for the GLaD, the player flies to Sigma Fulcrum and meets Yarod the first time. The player learns about the story of the station, strange artifacts and about an unknown thread - the Essence of the VOID.[This mission is introducing the VOID/Progenitor/TESCH to the story.[.
Essence of the VOID.
Ten years ago a Zirax science team found a technical artefact in a remote excavation site at the edge of their territory. The Salurian clan seems to have stolen the artifact and sold it to Polaris right away. That's at least what the company manager typed in the log. The company brought the artifact to this station for being examined in the exotic materials lab. We have put it in an extremely strong containment field, but that was not enough I think. I alarmed the company, but they did not want to listen. As always. [ Long story short, the artifact started to aggressively capture my AI core and turned the station's internal defenses against the crew. I could not do anything. The company lost two destroyers in the evacuation. [A brave scientist named Yarod Halden downloaded my routines to a cyborg for being evacuated, but he did not survive and I was left behind. The station core was bombarded with EMP. I survived because he had shut me down before the attack started. [As far as I can say I was reactivated five years after this incident by a caretaker looking for a helper cyborg. The station was reactivated and officially run by some civil management, while the real power was held by the Salurian using this station for their criminal endeavors. [A few months ago, the engineering cyborgs of the station suddenly started to build new machines. I noticed some of the Salurian were concerned. Talking about an artifact found in the caverns which allowed them to create a new drug that had interesting effects on the consumers. Strength, speed, spatial awareness increased .. and a sudden death in case of the dose only being slightly too high. [I started to investigate what happened. As it seems the artifact is - or was - a fragment of a larger entity found ten years ago by the Zirax archaeologists. They call it 'Essence of the VOID'. I found out that the Salurian did not intend to create that drug - the station itself started to produce it, after the Salurian experimented with the fragment. So the past events are about to repeat themselves. But this time, we have a chance to stop it before it kills all civilians on board..
As I already told the GLaD command, the station is producing a fluid of unknown properties. I have found several specimens of that material when I investigated what the pirates are doing here. This material does not exist in any world of this part of the galaxy. Neither the Zirax, nor the Kriel or any other faction uses this. The production plans indicate it is kind of a very advanced type of nanofluid enriched with nanobots. I doubt any of the known civilizations would be able to produce it .. although ....
There is a rumor of a race of machines, called the TESCH. They are said to reside somewhere towards the center of the galaxy. They were never seen in that sector of the galaxy and none of the known factions seem to have had any contact for hundreds of years. Possibly a hoax. Such an advanced civilization would not have slipped off the radar .. except it was their absolute intention. [Hm. When we make it out alive, we should try to convince the GLaD command to send an expedition force to the Excavation site where that 'Essence of the VOID' fragment was found. I managed to secure the coordinates at least. [But for now - the deletion programs I injected into the remote processors have not been detected. Seems like a different section of the artifact was infecting the AI this time. It is far less aggressive and less well protected. Maybe it was the production command core. Anyways. Let's save the sector for all you biological beings, shall we?.
While trying to find a trace of Alex' team (which was captured by the Zirax) you are making a new possible ally: Ambassador Hyzani, member of the House of Abyssal of the Zirax Empire.[In the course of the mission, the ambassador and the Keeper of the Archives provide a lot of detailed info about nearly all important current and historical events: [- the War of Silence[- the fall of the Talon-Zirax Assembly[- the rise of the Zirax Empire[- the VOID[- the Legacy[- the TESCH[Hyzani also indicates a conflict is rising between the Houses of the current Zirax Empire..
Ok, so a little history lesson in a brief summary: the TESCH are a civilization of AIs. They reside in a quite large territory more towards the center of the galaxy. The VOID are being found in the same region - although they do not seem to be.. active? The TESCH, on the other hand, are a living civilization, but they do not aim for any contact with us biological beings and no one has ever tried to get in touch with them for at least a few hundred years..
TESCH vs. Zirax Empire.
No, not even the Zirax Empire has had any real contact with them. Two or three centuries ago, there was a convoy heading for the center of the galaxy. The commander ran out of resources and they scavenged a field of debris. At least that's what the reports say, but it is more likely they unintentionally destroyed a TESCH collective in the process. As a result, the convoy was nearly fully eradicated and the remains were sent in a giant capsule to the Zirax Empire. [The House of Xenu and the Ghyst insisted on seeking revenge. Her majesty, the empress, was not willing to approve, so the Xenu and Ghyst ministers just used their powers and sent the fleets. None of them ever returned. After the ministers were removed from their positions her majesty and the loyalists forced a bill to not further provoke any military action from or with the TESCH..
Progenitor / TESCH / Legacy.
The Xenu and the Ghyst did not forget about that defeat against the TESCH and the empress. Since then they use every chance they have to increase their standing in the Empire. The conflict with the Kriel .. it is a result of their rage as well. But I digress. Back to the TESCH. [It is said that the TESCH or their ancestors once ruled the whole galaxy. Which I think might be correct as remains of an ancient civilization, which vanished thousands of years ago, are still to be found everywhere. These are often also called the 'Progenitors'. While I did my research about the LEGACY a few years ago, I also found a lot of evidence that the Progenitor seem to share some similarities with the LEGACY. At least to some extent, and although they might have never met. But I do not have any proof and this is not a very popular topic in the Imperial Academy for obvious reasons..
To be honest - I do not have any idea. It seems to be related to the TESCH to some extent. As I said, the VOID are reportedly found in the territory of the TESCH, but they seem to just be monolithic, black rocks. That's why I wanted you to bring me those artifacts. I will analyze them and in case I get new evidence, I would be honored to solve that riddle with your help as well..
The term LEGACY is used to describe an entity that is capable of infecting biological beings and transforming them into an infected, yet intelligent version. The so called Infected do not suffer from hunger, heat or cold, can breathe or live in the vacuum of space or in extremely radiated places. The first contact with Infected has been recorded just ahead of the War of Silence, which started 1300 years ago..
Scientific reports made during the War of Silence indicate that the LEGACY is a semi-material entity, bound to some structures in the real world. Usually these structures were holding a certain amount of Pentaxid element before they were converted to some radioactive alien metal (no data available). The LEGACY itself is not the sum of all the transformed biological beings under its control - not like a bee hive - but the sum of the energy it stole from them. [The exact method of this stealing process has not been found, but the investigations indicate that an infecting particle is somehow transferring the energetic spirit of any higher life form to a local pool of the entity. The local pools aggregate into 'Hive Nuclei'. When a Nucleus is strong enough, a local entity, referred to as 'hive mind' is created. This hive mind then tries to get in touch with other hive minds on nearby Nexus worlds. It also sends out ships that seed the 'Legacy particles' on new worlds.[It was found that the Legacy particle can only infect higher beings, but not animals or lower lifeforms. The particle does actually infect lower lifeforms, but dies without gaining control or being able to transform them. The controlling of infected higher lifeforms is a side effect, though. They are used as cannon fodder for the LEGACY. The hives are not weakened by killing these Infected. It only slows down the spread of the Legacy Particle. This knowledge was used by the Ghyst and the Xenu for the Infinite Life Forms (ILF) weapon (created by the Serdu), - after the destruction of several planets with conventional weapons did not succeed. [The ILF was deployed on many worlds, creating a myriad of unintelligent, lower lifeforms. The theory was that the LEGACY could be 'dried out' or at least distracted, while spending more and more effort to compensate for the loss of its Legacy Particles, while conventional weapons destroy their hives. This strategy seems to have been successful as the Legacy was pushed back to the edge of the galaxy. The War of Silence officially ended 900 years ago..
The glorious Zirax Empire was founded about 800 years ago, after the treachery of the Talon led to a civil war. The Talon-Zirax assembly was dissolved as a result and the Zirax Empire was born. It was founded by the most influential houses of the Zirax: The Xenu, the Ghyst, Rados, Epsilon, Serdu and Abyssal. The first empress was a member of the house of Serdu. In the beginning, this changed with nearly each new royal election. The last two centuries, the empress has always been a member of the House of Abyssal, though..
The Talon Treachery (Empire Version).
Even before the War of Silence, the Zirax houses did all the dirty work for the Talon-Zirax assembly. When the War of Silence came to its end, evidence was found by the Xenu that the Talon might have initiated the war intentionally to weaken the houses and overtake the rulership. Ghyst specialists found out that the Talon were using similar tech than the ships of the LEGACY and that they seem to have come from the same spot outside of this galaxy. The high court of the houses decided that, after the dust of war settled down, to disempower these traitors for the good of all biological beings. [Most of the Talon did not escape their deserved punishment and were enslaved or sent to reservations. There have been reports of a refugee fleet having fled into deep space. The glorious Zirax Empire is well aware about that and always ready to withstand their attack - or anyone else's..
The Talon Treachery (additional info).
Yeah, I had expected that you would find this questionable. But you need to know, the archive was created by my ancestors and only with the view of the glorious Empire in mind. Let me fill in some blanks and clarify a few details. [The 'evidence' the Xenu and the Ghyst found about the Talon having set up the War of Silence was already heavily disputed at that time. The specialist of the House of Abyssal later found out that the evidence was made up, faked or only half the truth. BUT, at this point no one did care, because the Houses have decided to take over the control. So they just used this reason - and everyone won. Except the Talon. A lot of the members of the Academy of Sciences were killed or imprisoned. But also a lot of the Talon, at least more than the Empire will admit, have fled into deep space. But never returned. [One thing of the evidence found back then seems to be correct: the Talon did use a similar tech than the LEGACY ships. Even the shapes of the ships were nearly identical. Also the weapons. And they came from a distant galaxy, Triangulum as you call it, as refugees as we found out. So there actually IS a connection between the Talon and the LEGACY. We just haven't found out what it is. I am feeling, we are so close....
While trying to rescue the GLaD team from a Ghyst  prison complex, you learn about a possible traitor inside the GLaD/UCH. You are also Alex the first time after more than a year -  after everyone in the UCH and GLaD though the player was dead / killed while having been dragged into the TITANs warp vortex with a not warp-capable vessel..
This was the first time you were learning about an ancient threat, called THE LEGACY. You got some early info from a cryo-contained prisoner called Specialist Kar'han. He gives a few, very rough info about a war against this entity, fought by the Zirax and Talon a long time in the past. You understand from what he was explaining, that the war did not go well and there was a serious conflict between the Talon and the Zirax. [You also learned that the Talon are not the primitive tribe they are showcasing themselves to the outer world. The Talon chief also indirectly confirms that you really arrived way after the Operation Phoenix fleet- which confirms the theory that you actually lost 1 year due to some hyperspace jump travel issues. [This mission is giving the very early info about all the non-UCH related story branches.[.
Indication of Zirax vs. Talon conflict.
Bi'phuah! Who are you? Some new Zirax scum? This isn't some high-value-target prison with some comfort to ex...  oh ...  You don't look like a Zirax!.
Then ... What are you waiting for! We don't have a lot of time left! The Legacy is seizing this world. The Infinite Life Program has failed. The Zirax scum have nothing better to do than arrest all the science officers. Quick - we need to get out of here!.
No time for chatter! I am feeling the Legacy already growing inside ... Oh. I remember. My brain already seems to be getting dysfunctional.  I am infected! This is a cryo-containment facility.  ... Listen, stranger, whoever you are, you need to get out of here now! The Legacy has infested this place ... and me. The Zirax will kill anyone who comes in contact with it. I wonder why this prison cell is even still here ... I'm certain the self-destruct sequence is already activated..
Stranger, no time for long discussions: Tell my people! I am specialist Kar'han! Chief Officer of ... the Talon-Zirax Assembly......
Translation of the plate.
It says: The Legacy once ruled all the worlds of this galaxy. Worlds fell apart and into silence, but the honorable Zirax, with the Infinite Life Program, were able to end the threat once and for all, and it might never return. Praise the High Command!.
Hmm ... I do believe the damage on the plate was done on purpose. [The glorious past. The Assembly. The Legacy. A tale of the past. A child-frightening story about a big threat. Emptying the inhabited worlds and ending a whole dynasty. Destroying a millennium of peace and prosperity.

[Captain Brenner and most of the flight team were killed just seconds ago. A projectile hit the bow amidships. I was incredibly lucky. My absolutely justified criticisms, made after we ran into this mess, caused the lieutenant to send me to check the lifeboats - seconds before the bridge was hit. Karma ? Maybe not. Now, I can't leave this room. The doors are sealed. I'm standing in front of the lifeboat section and cannot enter it, which doesn't matter anyway, as the whole section is missing and I am staring into the sky through a big hole in the hull. The ground is coming closer. I just heard the tearing of metal. The ship is breaking apart. This might be my final entry in this PDA. I'll put it here. Maybe I will continue it later. Hope at least our engineers did their job when creating these structurally strengthened sections. Emmerson, ensign, UCH Heidelberg.[.

[Timestamp: August, 26, 2473.[To whoever finds this.[The Heidelberg is lost. Only a few survived the crash. Palant has already made contact with the local natives, the Talon. They must have seen us coming down. We literally crashed on their front lawn. We are now heading towards the Talon settlement. The Zirax are on our heels, but seem to have lost interest .. or they are currently held up by the rest of the fleet. The last comm we got basically said the fleet is in retreat. The TITAN is lost, probably crashed on the Moon. Not sure if the crew survived. The MS GRAND has sent an encrypted signal which we hope the Zirax will not be able to decipher for a while. This is our ticket out of here. Some friends have put up a teleporter device in a wreckage area a few kilometers away. Emmerson, the lucky son of a .. , has generated a keycard. I am not sure if there are other ships coming down or other survivors. I'll leave a hint for those that might come later with instructions how to generate that keycard. For authentication, use 'AI Routine 34'. Otherwise the console will self-destruct instantly. If this plan fails, I advise every other survivor to go find one of the Talon villages. These guys helped us to survive, and might help you as well. [Good luck to us and whoever is reading this. See you soon.[- M.[.

The scheduled start has been set to 1600. Tomorrow. [ What? Mercer! Can you please tell the Council, that this is at least 24h too early? The warp drives are not ready. Not to mention all the other stuff that is missing... [ I am afraid, the countdown has already started. The other commanders will be informed in an hour about the new schedule. I checked the status of all ships. We should be ready, even for this accelerated schedule. [ I just checked the new mission parameters. All shore leaves have been canceled. The personnel on Apollon station, Titan station and the marine bases will be sent to the transports in the next 12h. Seems there is no way back, hmm?

Rescheduling the start to 24h earlier...[ They literally threw me out of my bed in the middle of the night. But yes, we managed to get this done just a few minutes before your arrival. [ Hey, ... before I forget, there is a new guy on the bridge ... Mencer? Mirse? Mercer? not exactly sure. Black suit. Spooky guy. [ Hmm ... I sense some trouble, but no real surprise. The whole project has gone a strange route. Don't you think? [ Do you remember when we were college students? When the first team started after the Hyperion was lost? Analyze the incident. Build a new science vessel. We can do it better.. blah blah blah ... all those pathetic speeches? [ Yes. We had a test about the Hyperion Incident and what followed from it in our science class in college. If I would have known that, after I signed up 5 years ago, that they are building a fleet.. With only two functional warp drives! I would have taken it for an April Fool's joke. [ Absolutely. And.. why do we need those turrets and even combat ships? And Marines? And fighters? All docked in two clusters around the two ships going to Proxima Centauri for a warp drive test and resource gathering? [ Feels like the Admirals want to invade a solar system. Like in the old star combat movies we watched last week. [ OK, I'd better get some sleep. Being prepared is everything. 'May the thought be with you.' [ Haha.. Send your colleagues to the cabins as well. You and your team have achieved something next to impossible in the given timeframe. I'll check the settings with the AI in the next few hours. Good night! [ Good night. See you later on the bridge. [ THEIA! Can you please try to sync the incoming waves with the modules to 0.2? We should try to minimize any signal loop, or any external disturbance will make this whole thing either a giant heater ... or an uncontrollable wave skimmer. [ Of course, Commander. Adjustments are in the works..
[Warp Core Control Room [T minus 5:02:13 [Commander Lamarr [Commander Mercer [===[ Hello, Commander Lamarr! [ Oh, hello Commander Mercer. Nice to have you here. I've heard you are now responsible for the warp engines and the protocols. And for having overwritten my repair protocols and tests the moment you stepped on board the TITAN? [ So, how can I help you? [ I am just having a look at the warp core. Impressive! [ Yes. Unbelievable what the techs have pulled out of that pile of junk in Antarctica four decades ago. Nothing but destroyed devices and incomplete blueprints but now, somehow it just magically works. Ok, well, not magically, you know what I mean. [ Yes, indeed. [ Just a question, if you don't mind? These black suits ... is this kind of an uniform? [ That's confidential. [ Oh. Ok. So, what exactly are you doing here? [ As I said, having a look at the warp core and its optimizations. [ Hmm. Ok. Then enjoy your stay. I am setting up the final routines. Or do you want to rewrite them right away? [ No worries. [ It seems there have been no issues with the schedule being moved forward, yes? [ Er, ahem, No. Sure. The teams have made exceptional progress since some office-sitter decided to throw them out of their beds. This, after already working weeks with nearly no sleep. [ That's obviously the risk of working in the expedition fleet, right? [ Ha ha. Tell you what, this whole 'expedition' thing is going a strange route. Not to mention, there's a Council that governs all the decisions and the UCH is somehow in the dark. Don't you think this requires some additional ... explanation? [ No. What should we explain? To whom? There is nothing secret about the expedition, for those that are involved. We'll tell the people what they need to know. [ Yes. That's exactly my point! As you might know, my grandpa was the lead engineer on the Hyperion. He was not lost with the ship only for one simple reason: someone decided to reschedule his shift. I'm thankful for that, but my grandpa never managed to get rid of the stigma of 'the coward that was left behind'. [ My dad moved to Mars with me after my grandpa's sudden death. I signed up for the fleet right after college, to show what our family is capable of. My dad said that Grandpa became crazy about this shit. Pretending the officials just want to silence everyone. Especially him personally, and the Hyperion Bereaved organization. All his stories of a 'planned accident.' The ship 'not being destroyed' and some 'threat' we are facing - all very dramatic. [ And, to be honest, until the last 24h, I always thought this old poor man simply could not cope with what happened. When you showed up on board the Titan, I suddenly remembered one of my grandpa's stories, about some 'black suits' visiting the Hyperion a few days ahead of the mission. [ Commander. Please... [ No! Listen, Mercer. I've been working for this project for nearly eight years now, and in these last few months, I've looked at this project and I've done the math. In the last week, and in the last 24 h in particular, so many strange things have happened. [ Did you know the GRAND and the TITAN each have several squads of marines on board? Sure you do. I checked the manifests yesterday. We have stashed away tons and tons and tons of high caliber ammo. I am an engineer. I know what these formulas and materials are made for. This is not for asteroid defense. So don't tell me this 'nothing is secret' bullshit. And now you are coming on board. And the first thing you do, is to mess around with the protocols I have been developing for the last five years. [ Commander. Calm down please. The adjustments we've made have been derived from important data, coming directly from Apollon labs. Dr Greyson and Dr. Dawson? You might know them. [ I do. But I have also looked at the changes you made. These are risky. I am not sure what they should do exactly. They don't seem to have any function that improves the efficiency of the warp drives. [ Rest assured, these have been approved by top specialists, everything is fine. [ Rest assured, that if something goes wrong .. and someone is harmed .. and I discover that it was because of your changes .. nothing will be fine ... for you..

This whole operation seems to have had totally different goals than the ones the teams were told. This should have been a short trip to Proxima Centauri to get more Pentaxid to help Earth survive. [But we ended up billions of light years beyond that point! In Andromeda![The fleet left the Jupiter orbit - forced by the Waverider Protocol as it seems. The irregular warp vortex we were dragged into might be the reason for the passage to Andromeda. A wavefront, which pushed us further than the warp drives could ever have achieved alone. It seems like this was not an accident, but finely planned to the minute. [I'm also not sure our little one-year delay was an accident either, ... planned as well, or a random side-effect?[The fleet was attacked immediately upon arrival here ... which makes me think those Zirax were waiting for them @w4 for some reason..

When the Elder Talon arrived in this unknown sea of stars, their failure in finding a new home world made them look for the next best alternatives.[Instead of a lush, water world, they made landfall on a dry, nearly deserted planet, consuming the last power units of their already severely damaged ships.[Left with the bare minimum, often not much more than what has been loaded to their escape vessels in a hurry, the Elder Talon survivors not only struggled with surviving the harsh environment, but also with rebuilding their society.[As a symbol of the past, demonstrating the will to stand their ground in this new world, the RHY'KAH Charged Crossbow, a former ceremonial weapon of the Academy Guards, became the symbol of these few, that made it over the dark, cold ocean of stars..
After having paid a high blood toll on their arrival and the first decades of surviving the harsh environments of their new home world, the new hope started to descend into darkness again.[Lacking the skills of their grandfathers that brought life to their planet, and lacking the technical understanding, for the ancient machines brought to the new world with these vessels, a rapid regression of culture and devolution of technology took place in only a few short generations.[The high civilization of the Elder Talon shattered into a batch of clans and a century of brotherhood wars began.[Although the Talon, as they now called themselves, were not able to repair the ancient machines, they were clever enough to create machines of war and death from their remains, like the Hata'M Charged Catapult..
After 1000 years, the darkness slowly came to an end. New inventions were made and the machines, that survived the battles, led the Talon into a new era of knowledge and prosperity.[Studying the ancient texts and remains of the old escape ships, made our great ancestors aware of their heritage, their former technical abilities and a legacy, they were willing to compete with.[While learning from old holo videos about the Academy of Sciences, which had ruled that distant galaxy they once fled from, and, although the most important info about the reason of the exodus from their original homeworld were missing - retrieved by scientists a few generations later - these Talon people, eager to mimic their mighty ancestors, formed the new Academy of Sciences and gave it a crucially different role: [The exploration and colonization of the stars.[.
After decades of expansion, the Talon were challenged by a federation of traders that tried to put their foot on all the Talon worlds. Never being the fighters, the Talon were on retreat from the beginning - until they found an emerging civilization that just made its first steps into deep space: The Zirax Empire.[Impressed by their assertiveness, and the Zirax, willing to benefit from the technological level offered in expense to defending the Talon Academy of Science, the Talon-Zirax Assembly was founded. After the war ended, the Talon-Zirax Assembly spread over the galaxy, encompassing thousands of worlds, peacefully ruling tens of species.[Then, all of a sudden, inhabited worlds fell silent. As they found out what was lurking in the dark, a shockwave went through the government and the Talon society in particular: The Legacy has followed them to this galaxy!.
Mercer: GLaD vs. New Eden.
Emmerson: Talon, Legacy & War of Silence.
After we escaped with our bare lives, there was a lot of discussion about what the fleet should do next. The two Admirals, my father and anyone with any relevant info, was either lost or dead. And when our voyage started, everything was chaotic as well. [After a few weeks it became clear, that we won't go back to earth anytime soon. So there was a fierce dispute on how to proceed. Although we had found a secret hiding place, some of the commanders and captains, led by Commander Lamarr, Commander Zerogen and others spoke to Vice Admiral Perez about supporting the local independence movement to find some allies and first and foremost gather more info that way, without running into the Zirax Empire again. [But Perez did not want to risk anything until we had built up a solid base of operations in that sector. She was also much more in favor of establishing the plans for the 'Project Eden'. Finding a planet for us to live on - or for others that might follow us to Andromeda now or in the future. [Anyways. As a result, Commander Lamarr and the others left the fleet and started the GLaD. I think, as things stand now, Perez is quite happy about that, because GLaD helped to lead the Zirax forces astray several times already. So, after misconceptions were ruled out on both sides, GLaD is now secretly working with the UCH fleet, nurturing the resistance movement of the Talon against the Zirax and trying to get hands on any info about our fate and what the hell is going on in this galaxy. [A short while ago, we actively tried to get in touch with you. Was quite a problem, but then one of our Talon agents managed to get hold of you. He was the guy upgrading your suit with our communication protocol. At the same time the Ilmarinen entered the sector and we found a way to implant an agent to the Polaris mining facility where the Staff of Guidance was found. [And then .. here we are I think..
The Talon seem to have been refugees, fleeing from the Triangulum galaxy. Fleeing from something what we know as 'The Legacy'. Still no idea what that exactly is, but it seems to be able to infect, control and even convert biological beings and machines. Pentaxid, the fuel of our warp drives and many other things, seems to play a role. The Ilmarinen, which you visited lately, was captured this way, when the unlucky crew dug up a part of an infected pentaxid asteroid and brought it on board. Bad idea. That's all we know about the Legacy so far. [On the Talon topic: Your latest information indicates, that after the Talon arrived in Andromeda, they fell back into barbary, but have made it back to space in a short amount of time. They found and raised the Zirax and because the Talon were more the brains than the muscles, the Zirax grew into the role of the latter. After some decades of peace, the War of Silence started when the Legacy managed to follow the Talon to Andromeda. [We do not yet know how this happened and also not how the war actually ended, but as far as we can say, the outcome was that the Talon were nearly eradicated from Andromeda. Not by the Legacy, but by the Zirax. That's where we still do not have a lot of information why this turned out as it did. You finding that cryogenized Talon prisoner named Kar'han indicates, that the Zirax turned against their century-long allies all of a sudden. [What we also know is, that The Legacy was defeated, but not destroyed when the War of Silence ended. And it seems as thought that entity is coming back to live more and more. As you, and others, already found out first hand. [Taking all that into account, there is one thing that does not make much sense at least to us: The Talon seem to still be technically capable of doing next-to-magical things, but those that are capable are hiding their knowledge even from their own tribes. We have now been working with them for nearly a year, but they still keep it a secret, why they do not use their abilities to their full extent. If you ask me, this is a bit suspicious. As if they are waiting for something..

Your people came here about one planetary rotation ago. [They seem to have fought with the Zirax patrols in orbit and some of their vessels crashed on this planet. [We helped them survive until they were able to escape.[So, please pardon our curiosity  ... but what are YOU still doing here? [How did you manage to escape the Zirax patrols for so long?.
