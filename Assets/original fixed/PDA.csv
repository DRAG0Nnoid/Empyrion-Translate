pda_KqaCq,"There isn't very much information available on the origin(s) of the Zirax Empire at this time, however Intel reports that the ancient Zirax were in touch with the 'Elder Talon' or 'Talon Guardian', and were given a technological boost from the advanced civilization. The Talon and Zirax were joined together in a technological and cultural Union, called the 'Talon-Zirax Assembly', which persisted for hundreds of years. It is not known yet why it collapsed, why they separated, or if it was a conspiracy. Files retrieved by the 2nd UCH recon unit indicated that the abominations found on the planets they occupied, seemed to have something to do with this or at least are related to a big incident in the past. These files were encrypted, classified and could not be deciphered until today. Their brutality and behavior towards the Talon or anyone not from a Zirax controlled faction, indicates that there is a lot more to uncover, than official reports tell us at the moment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_m0Qm9,"The rapid expansion directly affects how most of the Zirax bases are structured, which is clearly visible when entering the facilities. Zirax military structures are merely prefabs or standard templates. They are streamlined buildings with standardized functions, which enables the troops to get familiar with the base layouts before exiting a teleporter in a combat situation. Materials and specimens that UCH scientists have examined and brought back from those locations, have led to the impression that the facilities are “teleported” to the destinations as a whole. No one has seen this happen and there is no proof yet to say this is the case, so this is just a theory. \n\nZirax troops are often not stationed in the bases, and to maintain control of distant worlds within the territory of influence, troops will be teleported into central garrisons from an undisclosed location if a base is attacked. AI drones are mainly the first line of defense and surveillance, patrolling the area and guarding important POIs. These are controlled from a central server or by remote at a Drone base. Attack vessels in the outer rim territories operate similar to the AI drones. From what we have gathered from UCH troops on the ground who have captured a few of these vessels, these attack vessels are remote or AI controlled most of the time - with only few or even no crew at all, although the vessels are fully capable of transporting several hundred Zirax personnel. These vessels are  equipped with a self-destruction feature, which is triggered when the vessel is boarded by a non-Zirax crew. \n\nThere are rumors floating around that most of the Zirax enlisted foot soldiers are clones. This theory was brought up by a UCH science team while closely examining reports and video footage of an attack at a Zirax Bio-lab. During an interrogation of a lead scientist at the facility, the Zirax claimed that any further information could not be retrieved from the system. This may just be a diversion from the truth, since all the armored Zirax soldiers look identical to human eyes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_8SWSm,"[c][bcd3d4]The Empire seems to overstretch itself at an increasing rate, due to the extremely fast expansion rate. As a result, the Zirax government seems to fall short on capacities for building proper stations. This leaves them incapable of recruiting the necessary amount of specialized troops to fill these structures. This leads to a power vacuum in newly acquired systems, leaving them under strength and without order due to a lack of governance. The Kriel have recently started to challenge the Zirax and seized some of their star systems, as reports indicate.[-][/c]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

tasktitleTemperatur,Temperature - Radiation - Weather,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
acttitleTInfo,Temperatur,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
actdescTInfo,"[i[Q: What do the 2x3 number blocks aka environmental info below the radar minimap want to tell me?[/i]\nA1: The upper block is the TEMPERATURE. The big number on the left is the temperature at your CURRENT POSITION. The small upper number is your current BODY TEMPERATURE. The small lower number is only shown if you are inside a base or vessel. This is telling you the OUTSIDE TEMPERATURE. If you are outside a base or vessel, this is of course the same as the CURRENT LOCATION temp (and thus removed from the HUD to reduce confusion)\nA2: The lower block is the RADIATION. The big number on the left side is the radiation level on your CURRENT POSITION. The small upper number is your BODY RADIATION level. The small lower number is the OUTSIDE RADIATION. Same principle as with temperature: The latter is only shown when you are inside a vessel or a base and is removed if you are outside.\n\n[i]Q: How does Temperature work in general?[/i]\nA1: Each Planet has a MAX and MIN temperature. The max temperature is reached at 5 pm and the min temperature at 5 am. If you go higher up in the air, the temperature will decrease. Your suit will protect you from extreme temperatures - depending on its Temp MIN/MAX protection. (Can be enhanced by Boosters).\nA2: Space always has -270°C for most orbits (except a few) and is not suitable for ANY of the current suits for a longer stay (unboosted)\n\n[i]Q: Am i protected from high/low temperatures inside a base or vessel?[/i]\nIf it is activated, yes. If a station or vessel is powered, the temperature is heated up to 22-25° (Same for enclosed cockpits for SV and HV). So you are fine even with your interior suit. BUT this will not happen instantly! If your base is cooled to space temperature, it might take quite a while to heat up to a suitable temperature! No instant-heat-up!\n\n[i]Q: What happens if i am outside with a suit that cannot protect me from high/low temperatures?[/i]\nA1: If the temperature is higher or lower as your protection level, your body temp will slowly rise (or fall) towards the temperature at your current position. At a certain temperature, you will start to feel cold/heated up.\nA2: If it is too cold or hot outside, just go back into your base or vessel. This will heat up/cool down your body temp. BUT THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN INSTANTLY. If this takes too long, you'll of course die.\nA3: Tip: there are some foods and beverages that increase/decrease body temperature!\n\n[i]Q: Does a hull breach lead to the temperature dropping inside a base or vessel?[/i]A: Yes!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
acttitleRadInfo,Radiation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
actdescRadInfo,"[i]Q: How does Radiation work in general?[/i]\nSome of the planets and space have a certain amount of radiation. Radiation does not rise or decrease, it is constant for the whole playfield. The player armors have different protection values (which can be boosted). The interior suit does NOT protect you from any RAD level!\n\n[i]Q: Am i protected from Radiation inside a base or vessel?[/i]\nYes, even if it's deactivated. (this might be subject to change in the future)\n\n[i]Q: What happens if i am outside with a suit that does not protect me from the RAD level?[/i]\nA1: Your body radiation (small upper number on the right environment info block) will pile up and lead to serious problems after short.\nA2: Unlike with temperature, your BODY-RAD level will NOT automatically decrease if you return to a base or go back into your vessel. You need to use medication to reduce it ... or maybe take a shower? ;-)\n\n[i]Q: Does a hull breach in an radiated area lead to the inside of the base/vessel to be contaminated?[/i]\nCurrently there is no permanent contamination. But if you stand at the position of the hull breach, your radiation level might rise (although you are inside the base).\n\n[i]Q: Are there weather or environmental effects with radiation?[/i]\nYes! Occasional Radioactive Fog and Mist have been reported from some planets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
acttitleTempRadDevices,Temp and Rad for devices and blocks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
actdescTempRadDevices,"[i]Q: Do devices also have temperature and radiation?[/i]\nYES! Some of the devices will heat up or radiate the area around them, like Thrusters and Generators and Warp Drives.\n\n[i]Q: Can other blocks have temperature and radiation as well?[/i] Yes. For example the green Alien Building blocks are radioactive.\n\n[i]Q: Does the heat 'flow' into the room?[/i]\nCurrently there is no 'transition zone'. For devices, the radiation/temperature is limited to a fixed perimeter of ONE block around them. This is subject to change in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You can also trigger a weather change there as admin or in Single Player.\n\n[i]Q: Does weather affect the player like with temperature or radiation increase/decrease?[/i]Absolutely! You should go inside if a blizzard starts (if you are not equipped good enough) or if radioactive fog is rising.\n\n[i]Q: Does weather effects like meteors or lightnings damage player or structures?[/i]\nA: A player can get harmed by sudden temperature rise/drops and radioactivity and by acid rain or fire rain/meteor fire storm. There is currently no effect on bases or vessels (yet).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tasktitleOxygenRooms,Oxygenated Rooms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
acttitlelORglobal,How to oxygenate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
actdescORglobal,"[i]Q: What do i need to oxygenate a base or vessel?[/i]\nA1: You need an O2 tank and a ventilator. And your base needs to be powered.\nA2: Place the ventilator in each room that you want to be oxygenated and add some O2 to the O2 tank. Open the control panel. Activate the base and tick the checkbox 'O2'. This will fill up all the rooms with a ventilator with O2 - given your O2 capacity is high enough. The ventilator needs to be 'active' of course.\nA3: Use the DEBUG MODE in the Build Helper Menu (N) to visualize O2.\nA4: If your O2 capacity/filing status is too low to oxygenate your base, the process will fail. Add more O2 Tanks or O2.\n\n[i]Q: How long does it take for a large room to be filled with O2?[/i]\nThis happens pretty instant (maybe a second or two)\n\n[i]Q: How do i know how much O2 i need to fill all the rooms that are connected?[/i]\nLook for the OXYGEN stats in the STATISTICS tab of the Control Panel. There are three values given to indicate demand, tank size and current fillstate of the base.\n- If a hull breach happens, the O2 in this room is lost, BUT the vents will not try to refill the affected room! So the ventilator is still active, but will not waste precious O2.\n\n- If you deactivate your base and your O2 tanks are full, the O2 in your base is lost.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
acttitleOquest,Gameplay Questions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
actdescOquest,"[i]Q: Are oxygenated rooms available for all vessels and structures?[/i]\nYes!\n\n[i]Q: Do i consume less O2 when i am in an oxygenated room with helmet off compared to helmet equipped?[/i]\nYes! But you even use up your suit O2 less fast if your helmet is still unfolded in an oxygenated base.\n\n[i]Q: Are there different pressure levels?[/i]\nNo. The atmosphere in a room either has O2 or not.\n\n[i]Q: Which blocks are airtight?[/i]\nA: Have a look at the block info panel for infos about airtight value. Most of the doors are airtight for example - but not all. Airtight doors have a blue containment field active while sealing a room\n\n[i]Q: Can i switch off the containment field of a door to let O2 flow?[/i]\nNot yet.\n\n[i]Q: What happens if i open a door? Will O2 flow in the next room?[/i]\nBasically no. There are non-airtight doors that do not hinder the flow of O2 either open or closed. All other doors (including hangar doors, shutter doors) have a sealing field to keep the O2 inside. This field cannot (yet) be deactivated manually, but depends on the global on/off status of the base.\n\n[i]Q: Does O2 get lost if i open a hangar door and deactivate the base?[/i]\nNo. If you deactivate your base, a decompressing sequence is run and all the O2 is moved back into the tanks (if there is enough room. If not, the excess is lost).\n\n[i]Q: Does O2 get lost if someone blasts a hole in may base / If i remove a block thats leading to a hole in the wall?[/i]\nA1: IF this is a 'hull breach' to the non-O2 outside world or space either by damage or by removing the 'wrong block' the O2 in the room is lost.\nA2: In this case, the Ventilator is not shut down, but it also will not try to refill the room. So no additional O2 is lost after the hull breach happens.\n\n[i]Q: Do players in my base use up the O2 in the tanks?[/i]\nA: YES! If you are in your base (helmet off) you and any other player will use up a certain amount of O2 over time (reducing the total amount > T )",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

actdescBooster,"[i]Q: Which types of boosters are available at the moment?[/i]\nArmor, Jetpack, Temperature, Radiation, O2, Mobility, Multi, EVA.\n\n[i]Q: How many boosters can I use simultaneously?[/i]\nDepends on the slots available. This is different for each Player Armor. Interior Suits have no booster slots.\n\n[i]Q: Are there limitations on how many boosters of the same kind I can use simultaneously?[/i]\nNo. You can for example stuff all of the slots with Armor Boosters...but you might also pile up the penalties each of the boosters has.\n\n[i]Q: Can I build all of the boosters?[/i]\nNo, boosters need to be found or traded. You cannot build them (yet).\n\n[i]Q: Where do I get boosters?[/i]\nBoosters are available from loot. More possibilities will be added in the future.\n\n[i]Q: Do I lose boosters if I die?[/i]\nCurrently not. You are respawned in your last equipped player armor incl. the boosters that were added to this player armor\n\n[i]Q: How can I change / apply boosters?[/i]\nYou need to go to a Armor locker. Access the device and change suits or add/remove boosters\n\n[i]Q: Do I need to re-add boosters every time I change the player armor?[/i]\nNO! The boosters are saved to your Player Armor slots.

tasktitleSI,Structural Integrity (SI),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
acttitleSIwork,How does SI Work?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
actdescSIwork,"Here are a few basic SI rules you need to take into account: \n\n1. Only blocks that are touching the ground will be 100% stable (does not depend on the material used) \n\n2. You can only achieve 100% stability for a vertical row of blocks, if the lowest block is touching the ground. If you have a 100% stable block, a so called 'anchor block', you can build a vertical pillar on top of it as high as the sky. There is no vertical limit (yet). \n\n3. If you add blocks to such a 100% stable pillar in any horizontal direction, so each block that is attached in a row, any additional block will have a lower stability - until the row reaches a breaking point. The maximum range or breaking point for a horizontal, floating, not supported beam made out of any of the four base materials is 12 blocks. Note: The anchor block will keep its stability, as there is no such thing as shear force (yet)! [u]Tip:[/u] if your line or area of blocks is showing weak spots, just build a supporting pillar! \n\n4. Do not put heavy materials or devices on top of an already weak beam or weak foundation. You might risk the construction to collapse and your devices will be destroyed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
acttitleBAcollaps,My Base Collapsed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
actdescBAcollaps,"[i]Q: My base has suddenly broken apart. What did i do wrong?[/i]\n- If you started a blueprint from Pre-Alpha, first start a creative game, switch off SI (Open Console with Tabulator button, enter 'SI off') and make a new blueprint. This will fix most of the problems – except a non-SI conform design.\n- Hold N and select the SI Overlay to visualize the structural integrity of your base while building. \n- Technical note: The SI is recalculated with every new block you are adding or removing - not in advance!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

acttitleBrotate,Rotating Blocks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
actdescBrotate,"[i]Q: How does the block rotation work?[/i]\nYou can rotate blocks BEFORE and AFTER you have placed them: \n\n[u]BEFORE:[/u] If you want to place a new block, you might notice a green line sticking out from the block. This is the ROTATION AXIS. Change with INSERT or DELETE (Default). If you use HOME or END (default), the block will rotate around the Axis line clockwise or counter-clockwise! Use PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN buttons to move the block up and down vertically! \n\n[u]AFTER:[/u] If you placed a block and would want to rotate it afterwards, you need to equip the Multitool and use its Rotation-Mode (Select via RMB). Aim at a block and you will see the ROTATION AXIS. From here, rotating the block works like when placing a new block (INS/DEL to change Axis, HOME/END to rotate the block).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

tasktitleTSigLog,Triggers - Sensors - Signal Logic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
acttitleTriggers,Triggers and Sensors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
actdescTriggers,"[i]Q: What are 'triggers'?[/i]\nA1: In 6.0 we added a range of sensors that can send a signal to devices, thus changing their operation parameters. For example: pull a lever and have a door closed or a light switched off.\n
 A2: Current triggers / sensors: Trigger plate, Light barrier, Motion sensor, Lever..\n\n[i]Q: Are there different types of sensors?[/i]\nA: Yes! The lever has a defined On/Off status. If you move it into ON position, the signal is sent constantly to the device. Most of the other sensors are 'switches'. They only send the signal as long as a player or the vessel is in their detection range. See more details in EXAMPLES in 'How to setup'.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
acttitleHowto,How to setup,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
actdescHowto,"[i]Q: What can we do with basic triggers / sensors at the moment?[/i]\nBasically create simple logics: Activate devices, Open / close devices, Lock / unlock devices. Different devices may offer some, all or a selection of these actions (Depending on what the device can do)\n\n[i]Q: Can i create more complex circuits?[/i]\nYes, see the chapter about SIGNAL LOGIC!\n\n[b]EXAMPLES (for easy sensor-trigger builds)[/b]\n\n= Modes =\n\n1. FOLLOW\n
 Lever: Move handle to ON = ON. OFF = OFF\nSwitch: Enter the trigger area = ON, Leave the trigger area = OFF\n\n2. TOGGLE\nLever: Do not use with lever (works, but you might need to pull the handle 2x to get an effect)\n
 Switch: Enter and leave the trigger area = switches the status of the device (to ON if OFF, to OFF if ON)\n\n3. ON and OFF\nLever: Do not use (makes no sense)\nSwitch: sets status of the device to a dedicated ON or OFF status (not using its previous state!) Triggering the trigger again will not have an effect (ON-TIME-change)\n\n= How to SETUP =\n\n1. Place a trigger (let's use a trigger plate)\n2. Face the Trigger Plate and hit P\n3. If the Trigger Plate is highlighted in CP, you'll notice a new text below the device list: Tx Signal [field]\n4. Enter TEST to the field and hit return\n5. Place a Light\n6. Face the Light and hit P\n7. If the Light is highlighted in the CP, you'll notice a new entry ON/OFF as well as two dropdowns and a checkbox with an ' I ' below the device list\n7a: Expand the first dropdown and you'll find your TEST command. Select the TEST command to connect the Light to your Trigger Plate\n7b: Expand the second dropdown > You can use FOLLOW, TOGGLE, ON and OFF to trigger the Explosives.\n\nNow ...\n- IF you want a Player to have the light switched to ON or OFF when he touches the trigger plate, use either ON or OFF\n- IF you want the light to switch to OFF if it was ON (or vice versa), use TOGGLE\n- IF you want the light to only shine as LONG as the player is on the plate, use FOLLOW\n- IF you want the light to dim as LONG as the player is on the plate, use FOLLOW and toggle INVERT ( I checkbox)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
acttitleTtips,Handling Tips,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
actdescTtips,"[i]Q: Can i trigger several devices from the same sensor?[/i]\nYES! Just use the SAME signal name in each of the devices. This way it is possible to - for example - switch a range of lights on or off with only one button/sensor\n\n[i]Q: Can i trigger a device from several sensors?[/i]\nYes, just use SIGNAL LOGICs!\n\n[i]Q: Can i trigger the NPC spawners (for POI design)?[/i]\nYes! Place the NPC spawner and switch it OFF in the Control Panel. Then just connect your sensor. If a player triggers the sensor, the NPCs will be spawned.\n\n[i]Q: Can i trigger the PORTAL (for Instances)?[/i]\nOf course!\n\n[i]Q: Can i adjust the range and area of sensors?[/i]\nFor some sensors like motion sensor and light barrier, this is possible. Just access the sensor (aim at it and hit P) and you'll see its range and a range slider.\n\n[i]Q: Do sensors only trigger for players and vessels?[/i]\nA1: Yes, sensors trigger for both player avatars and vessels.\nA2: Please note: Motion Sensor and Light Barrier are active as long as a player or vessel is in their field of view. They do NOT deactivate if you just stand still at your position!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
acttitleSignal,Signal Logic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
actdescSignal,"[b]Note: Signal Logic is an extension of the Signal/Trigger mechanic, offering new ways on how to connect sensors and triggers in certain, more elaborate ways. Hit the SIGNAL LOGIC button on top of the Control Panel to access.[/b]\n\n[i]Q: What is the purpose of SIGNAL LOGIC circuits?[/i]\nThey allow you to do things that the standard device-based signal-dropdown would not allow you to do, like connecting different sensors to a several other devices.\n\n[i]Q: How do I use it?[/i]\nPretty much the same as you would set up a sensor-trigger array..but with more parameters/options/gates, like AND, OR, XOR, Inverter, Delays (more planned).\n\n[i]Q: How do I set it up?[/i]\nSame as above: Have some sensors placed at your structure. Access them directly or via Control Panel and give them a unique signal name. Then open SIGNAL LOGIC, add a new circuit. Select your sensor signal on the left side. Add a name for the output signal on the right side. Go to the devices that you want to manage with the circuit and add the output signal to your devices signal dropdown.\n\n[i]Q: What are the different gates doing?[/i]\nAND = All sensors added to the circuit need to trigger for the signal to be sent. Example: If you have 2 trigger plates, the light will only be lit if both plates are triggered at the same time (one player standing on each)\nOR = If one or more of the added sensors are triggered, the signal is sent to the device. Example: A light is illuminated if you stand on one of the trigger plates, but also if both plates are triggered.\nXOR = sends signal only if only ONE of the two attached sensors is activated. Does not trigger if both sensors are active. Example: the light will only illuminate if exactly one plate is triggered. If both are triggered, no signal is sent and the light remains dark.\n
 INVERTER = inverts the signal (f.ex. to OFF if an ON signal is sent). Example: A light is switched off if you step on a trigger plate. Also useful when you have two triggers and you need them both to be the same in order to pass an AND gate.\nSET/RESET Latch = Use for two sensors: sensor A sets and sensor B resets if triggered.\nDELAY = creates a simple delay modificator for a single-signal. Click on the button-box to add a value (seconds)\n\n[i]Q: Can I combine the signals coming from a circuit and use it in a new circuit?[/i]\nOf course! Just use the outgoing signal name and select it for the input side. You can create complex circuits this way. Of course you should not delete the underlying circuit for your enhanced circuit or it will break the queue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By the end of the 24th century, after the wars and catastrophic events leading into the 'dark 23th century' calmed down more and more, the UCH was re-founded as kind of a worldwide government by the surviving nations and local governments. Power was granted to the UCH authority to take care of the survival of the Terran civilization.\n\nHistory\nWith the discovery of the alien ship in 2402 AD, the dark era for mankind ended all of a sudden. The UCH, founded nearly a century before, was able to use the find and retrieve most of the technological knowledge buried in the ice of Antarctica. This phase did not last very long as this new technology required some materials that were not obtainable in earth's solar system, but in the nearby Proxima Centauri system. Operation Phoenix, which was Earth’s last ditch effort to save itself from falling back in the dark age, was spearheaded by its flagship, the TITAN. The voyage was troubled by an unknown energetic effect, leading to the arrival in Andromeda, instead of the targeted Proxima Centauri. UCH vessels made first contact with a species known as the Zirax. Outgunned and caught off guard by the enemy, losses were abundant in the initial contact with this new species. Ships, crew members and materials were lost in an instant and Earth’s flagship the TITAN was destroyed and nearly all of the UCH’s leading officers were killed. The remaining ships, including the 2nd command ship GRAND, managed to retreat from the battle. They were able to hide in deep space, out of range of the Zirax Empire.  \n\nScientists are still gathering data and examining whether the term 'Empyrion' used loosely throughout history is a physical location or a spiritual/philosophical belief.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's an agile craft equipped with a pair of underside Miniguns for anti-personnel ground combat and a pair of topside cannons for anti-aircraft combat.\nUnlike the armed freighters it replaced, the Korat isn't warp-capable instead relying on a Tender to transport Cutters in-bulk between sectors. With the tenders mounting up to 8 cutters each, they're primarily used for anti-piracy action for pursuing smaller, agile enemies to ground.

Relegated to the task of patrol duty, parade and support roles, they number now only in the hundreds.\n\nThe Periat-class have a hangar beneath the combat bridge, accessed from the rear; four forward-facing rocket batteries mounted top and bottom to engage enemies ahead, with four flak turrets mounted top and bottom to cover the rear and blind spots of the forward rocket batteries.

However, due to the need for defense around their home systems and border patrols at the edge of controlled space, it's generally quite rare to encounter one in the area between the two zones.\n\nUnlike the older model Periat and Sunat class ships, the Imerat consolidates the majority of its infrastructure into a single, heavily armored body instead of spreading it out amongst an array of modules and arms. Giving away space normally used for crew for the mass of machinery required to run the engines and a high-output nuclear reactor far in excess of what the ship needs to run.\nThe general theory behind the use of such a high output generator is as an external power supply for establishing bases in the field; with the reactor connecting directly the bases infrastructure since it's more efficient to run the reactor constantly than to shut it down when not needed.\n\nThe Imerat's arsenal seems impressive on paper, but much of it is low-output energy weapons designed for combating legacy infestations and swarmships. While it has significant artillery, it's distributed for forward firing and orbital bombardment and isn't suitable for high-speed engagements, being at a disadvantage against a single small, fast-moving craft. For this reason, it has a set of rails on the rear to which a pair of fighters are usually docked to protect the ship's vulnerable rear.\n\nAttack value: \nDefense value: \n\nWeapons: 8x Pulse Laser, 1x Rocket, 2x Flak, 3x Plasma, 3x Artillery, 7x Sentry\nShield:\nDrones:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the prow of the ship being up to 15 meters thick, allowing the Tovera the resilience to withstand a direct impact with an Infector's reinforced shell with the infector coming out worse off.\n\nWith the resurgence of the Legacy, Rados shipyards have been working flat out to produce more Dreadnoughts, with the current count of Dreadnoughts in active service being estimated at 68.

It is a lot more costly to use and maintain when used on planetary drones compared to other purely projectile or other specialized energy based weapons.

The downside of the prototype concept: it does no damage to medium or heavy armor and only little to standard armor.

pda_K0ieK,"During the War of Silence, the Infector was the Legacy's vanguard in every direct engagement. Acting as both warship and frontline base for the spread of the Legacy onto protectorate planets the Infectors could cut a swathe through frigates and destroyers defending a planet before dropping from orbit like a meteorite onto densely populated areas.\nOnce landed, the Infectors would extend tendrils into the ground and begin spreading both viral and mutagenic compounds into the environment to modify those left injured, dying or dead from the impact.\n\nHundreds of cycles since the war, the scars and effects left by the Infectors can still be seen and in many cases have become a source of raw materials and rare isotopes used in everything from medicine and weapons to warp drive components and fuel. These irradiated zones still produce mutated creatures born from the Legacy Virus, but without the connection or intelligence that made them the efficient killing machines they were.\n\nThe Infector, or ""Nautilus"" consists of a segmented circular shell of significant strength and thickness that protects the equally rigid mechanics of the interior. The shell's thickness is required for the entity to survive the impact from orbit which many still failed to do after being damaged by defending ships.\nWhile the body of the entity possesses no defensive armaments, a pair of defense rings float an exact distance from the eye of the nautilus' shell providing a full sphere of coverage with powerful Anti-Proton beam emitters.\n\nAttack Value: \nDefense Value: \n\nWeapon Type: Anti-Proton beam\nShield:\nDrones:",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the entity damaged beyond recovery 60% of the time.) they were typically found as a rear guard for the Infectors in planetary assaults or as protection for Hiveships.\nAn Infector-class biocraft that has successfully landed and absorbed natural materials, will in many cases transition into a Decimator, rise into orbit and assume the task of supporting invasion with new infectors on another location.

Then it will take a while to load up again.\n\nBoosting does not consume extra fuel or energy at the moment and it is also not visible by an extra effect on the thrusters, yet.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_AW8OK,HUD Info / Loading,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_O4i0q,The HUD is showing the load status with a circle below the MOVEMENT element on the right side of the HUD (see screenshot in the 1st post of this thread or in the HUD info  thread! \n\nThe BOOST will load up only when the vessel or the thrusters are On/powered.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_8KuWG,Boost Directions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_uS8eG,"The boost is available in ANY direction for which a boost-capable thruster is available. Said that, BOOST is not an ""afterburner"" tech, only accelerating the ship forward, but BOOST can also be used to the side,up or down or even backward, for example to come to a full stop faster.

pda_Ou8Oi,Function,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_mcWS8,There are two possibilities to generate torque for a vessel\n1. RCS devices (fixed output independent of placement)\n2. Thrusters generate torque based on their position on the vessel and their thrust direction.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_Kmoi4,Thruster Torque - Calculation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_OmmfG,"Other than for RCS devices, the calculation of thruster-torque depends on a lot of factors ( inertia tensor of the ship, the positions and orientations of all the thrusters of the ship compared its the center of mass,..etc) BUT information about what amount of torque is contributed by RCS and/or Thrusters is available in the STATISTIC tab of the control panel.\n\n[u]Important NOTE: [/u]The thrust-torque always generates in relation to the planes created by the different axis spread from the CENTER OF MASS, not anything else! \n\n[u]What means: [/u]Thrusters generate rotation around the two axes perpendicular to the thruster direction, with a strength proportional to the thrusters' distance from the center of mass. Ships always rotate around their center of mass.\n\n[u]Example: [/u]\nIf your thrusters you use to produce a Yaw are not exactly in the horizontal plane containing the center of mass, then this will generate mostly a Yaw but also some small Pitch and some Small Roll. If the ship is not able to cancel those other unwanted rotations (here Pitch and Roll) with some other thrusters it will cancel the rotation and not turn.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_6eiJG,Explanation and Usecase,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_00Wq8,"Aerodynamics can be used to build plane-style vessels that work in atmospheres with only a back-facing thruster (and a forward facing for braking!)\n\n[u]The mechanic is pretty straight forward:[/u]\nAs long as the ground-facing surface of your vessel is large/big enough, it might create enough uplift to allow your vessel to be leveled with the horizon and NOT drop to the grown as you are moving forward fast enough. (This is NOT a full real-world simulation of course!)\n\nIf you vessel is heavy and you are going too slow and the shape is not really optimal (although you will not need a wing-only style vessel to make this work!!) you will not achieve the same performance and possibly drop to the ground.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_0S8aM,Thruster Torque,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_S14Oq,"[u]Tips[/u]\n[u][/u]- Spreading out the thruster from the center of mass of the vessel will increase the torque!\n  - Depending in which direction the thruster points and where it is placed, it will add its torque to roll, yaw or pitch\n  - Unlike the BOOST, torque will be added by ANY thruster (JET and Standard)\n- You do NOT need an RCS to roll or pitch or yaw your vessel! (Also saves CPU points)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_8eWWK,Definition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_quiKW,"The VIRTUAL DRAG, although it will have a lot of impact on the TOP SPEED (not to confuse with the TECHNICAL max speed of the vessel class; see explanation above) of your vessel and depends a lot on how you shape your vessel, is the feature that possibly requires the least of explanations.\n\nThe system is very simple and can be put in between these two extremes:\n\n  - If your vessel is build more like an arrow, you might be able to rise the TOP SPEED of your vessel up to the TECHNICAL MAX SPEED of your vessel type just by building and with only few thrusters.\n  - If you build a flying brick, the TOP SPEED of your vessel might not even be close to the TECHNICAL MAX SPEED of your vessel type and you might need to reduce mass or increase thrust.\nThis accounts for ALL movement directions, as well as for roll/yaw/pitch!\n\nVirtual drag takes into account the overall shape of the vessel.\n\nThe Virtual Drag values are  visualized on the STATISTIC page or - together with the other flight mechanic values - on a dedicated, new Control Panel tab",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_Sei0K,"[u]Why is it called VIRTUAL DRAG?[/u]\nBecause it is NOT the physical (aerodynamic) drag alone, but a combination of a lot of factors. The term ""VIRTUAL DRAG"" is a hand term to describe the methods and factors used to define the TOP SPEED of your vessel (which might not necessarily range up to the technical max speed of the vessel type)!\n\nFor example in space the single factor ""drag"", that you only have in an atmosphere, is of course not present, but other factors like mass and thruster capability are still weighted in.\n\n[u]Why is this also affecting ships in space?[/u]\nThe VIRTUAL DRAG to some extent compensates for the inevitable technical limitations of the game environment and engine. Also, as we do NOT want Empyrion to be a physics simulation, we cannot fully use real world physics and mechanics, for example thrust power, mass, volumes etc. \n\nBy limiting the technical max speed, we have to find a middle ground between technical possibilities and a gameplay that is fun but not too simplified. The VIRTUAL DRAG (As well as other features) add a new challenge in terms of an additional balancing parameter -  which can be overcomed either by building and design or by using CPU Points in terms of investing in thrust or RCS.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

pda_0804q,"The algorithm calculates the amount of sun-rays that will hit the solar panel for a certain placement during the day. \n\nThe placement affects their efficiency :\n- This average efficiency is then displayed with the GREEN LCDs (up to four LED lights)\n- The current efficiency is displayed by the YELLOW LED lights (up to four LED lights)\n\nIf solar panels produce more electricity than currently needed, the surplus energy is stored in the Capacitor (Solar) block like in a battery.\n\nTo display the surplus of energy (or the “energy reserve”), there is now a battery icon in the main page of Control Panel that shows the current content of the battery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_C4Omq,"- Placement behind an obstacle (tree, stone, base, mountain etc)  leads to a reduced efficiency\n- Stronger Light Intensity on the playfield increases efficiency on a global scale (parameter: DayLightIntensity in playfield.yaml).\n- Light Intensities overall impact on the efficiency is  influenced by the weather condition in a second step: eg when it is cloudy or raining, light intensity effect decreases and thus also efficiency of panel\n- Angle of panel towards sun: best efficiency when sun hits perpendicular on panel (eg on equator a flat solar panel lying on ground will have highest efficiency at noon, while a sloped solar panel close to pole while be better)\n- AtmosphereDensity: higher density = less overall efficiency\n- AtmosphereDensity is modified by latitude! Example: If the position of the Solar Panel is closer to the poles, it is less efficient for the same AtmosphereDenisty factor, because sun travels through more atmosphere than on equator.\n- Ground fog reduces efficiency",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This avoids being trapped in a mined out hole. The drone has a range of 60m and will teleport the ores directly into your inventory.\n- Park a vessel nearby and use the Logistics Network to connect to a container. The ores will go right there then.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_OeGiq,"Vessel-drills work the same as handheld drills, except they are fired from the pilot seat.\nYou can also equip drill turrets for vessels. \n\nNote:\nFor vessel-based mining make sure you have your vessel equipped with a 'Container Controller (Ore and Wood)' and an appropriate amount of 'Container Extensions' to hold the ores - otherwise the drilled materials will drop on the ground or float away into deep space.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_Oii4K,Autominers can be placed on SSOR and voxel deposits. They need to be powered and you need to pick up the ores from their internal containers.  \n\nTip: Use the connected toolbar for transferring large quantities of heavy/voluminous ores to a nearby vessel.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

pda_muaSm,"Ten years ago a Zirax science team found a technical artefact in a remote excavation site at the edge of their territory. The Salurian clan seems to have stolen the artifact and sold it to Polaris right away. That's at least what the company manager typed in the log. The company brought the artifact to this station for being examined in the exotic materials lab. We have put it in an extremely strong containment field, but that was not enough I think. I alarmed the company, but they did not want to listen. As always. \n\n Long story short, the artifact started to aggressively capture my AI core and turned the station's internal defenses against the crew. I could not do anything. The company lost two destroyers in the evacuation. \n\nA brave scientist named Yarod Halden downloaded my routines to a cyborg for being evacuated, but he did not survive and I was left behind. The station core was bombarded with EMP. I survived because he had shut me down before the attack started. \n\nAs far as I can say I was reactivated five years after this incident by a caretaker looking for a helper cyborg. The station was reactivated and officially run by some civil management, while the real power was held by the Salurian using this station for their criminal endeavors. \n\nA few months ago, the engineering cyborgs of the station suddenly started to build new machines. I noticed some of the Salurian were concerned. Talking about an artifact found in the caverns which allowed them to create a new drug that had interesting effects on the consumers. Strength, speed, spatial awareness increased .. and a sudden death in case of the dose only being slightly too high. \n\nI started to investigate what happened. As it seems the artifact is - or was - a fragment of a larger entity found ten years ago by the Zirax archaeologists. They call it 'Essence of the VOID'. I found out that the Salurian did not intend to create that drug - the station itself started to produce it, after the Salurian experimented with the fragment. So the past events are about to repeat themselves. But this time, we have a chance to stop it before it kills all civilians on board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I managed to secure the coordinates at least. \n\nBut for now - the deletion programs I injected into the remote processors have not been detected.

pda_OuKq2,"While trying to find a trace of Alex' team (which was captured by the Zirax) you are making a new possible ally: Ambassador Hyzani, member of the House of Abyssal of the Zirax Empire.\n\nIn the course of the mission, the ambassador and the Keeper of the Archives provide a lot of detailed info about nearly all important current and historical events: \n- the War of Silence\n- the fall of the Talon-Zirax Assembly\n- the rise of the Zirax Empire\n- the VOID\n- the Legacy\n- the TESCH\n\nHyzani also indicates a conflict is rising between the Houses of the current Zirax Empire.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_eqOKi,"Ok, so a little history lesson in a brief summary: the TESCH are a civilization of AIs. They reside in a quite large territory more towards the center of the galaxy. The VOID are being found in the same region - although they do not seem to be.. active? The TESCH, on the other hand, are a living civilization, but they do not aim for any contact with us biological beings and no one has ever tried to get in touch with them for at least a few hundred years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_WSaiu,TESCH vs. Zirax Empire,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_KY4cd,"No, not even the Zirax Empire has had any real contact with them. Two or three centuries ago, there was a convoy heading for the center of the galaxy. The commander ran out of resources and they scavenged a field of debris. At least that's what the reports say, but it is more likely they unintentionally destroyed a TESCH collective in the process. As a result, the convoy was nearly fully eradicated and the remains were sent in a giant capsule to the Zirax Empire. \n\nThe House of Xenu and the Ghyst insisted on seeking revenge. Her majesty, the empress, was not willing to approve, so the Xenu and Ghyst ministers just used their powers and sent the fleets. None of them ever returned. After the ministers were removed from their positions her majesty and the loyalists forced a bill to not further provoke any military action from or with the TESCH.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_OWC8q,Progenitor / TESCH / Legacy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_C8WWK,"The Xenu and the Ghyst did not forget about that defeat against the TESCH and the empress. Since then they use every chance they have to increase their standing in the Empire. The conflict with the Kriel .. it is a result of their rage as well. But I digress. Back to the TESCH. \n\nIt is said that the TESCH or their ancestors once ruled the whole galaxy. Which I think might be correct as remains of an ancient civilization, which vanished thousands of years ago, are still to be found everywhere. These are often also called the 'Progenitors'. While I did my research about the LEGACY a few years ago, I also found a lot of evidence that the Progenitor seem to share some similarities with the LEGACY. At least to some extent, and although they might have never met. But I do not have any proof and this is not a very popular topic in the Imperial Academy for obvious reasons.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_sSSa0,VOID,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_OOWOj,"To be honest - I do not have any idea. It seems to be related to the TESCH to some extent. As I said, the VOID are reportedly found in the territory of the TESCH, but they seem to just be monolithic, black rocks. That's why I wanted you to bring me those artifacts. I will analyze them and in case I get new evidence, I would be honored to solve that riddle with your help as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_Ci4aW,The LEGACY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_ACe2C,"The term LEGACY is used to describe an entity that is capable of infecting biological beings and transforming them into an infected, yet intelligent version. The so called Infected do not suffer from hunger, heat or cold, can breathe or live in the vacuum of space or in extremely radiated places. The first contact with Infected has been recorded just ahead of the War of Silence, which started 1300 years ago.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_OOWTO,War of Silence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_cme8m,"Scientific reports made during the War of Silence indicate that the LEGACY is a semi-material entity, bound to some structures in the real world. Usually these structures were holding a certain amount of Pentaxid element before they were converted to some radioactive alien metal (no data available). The LEGACY itself is not the sum of all the transformed biological beings under its control - not like a bee hive - but the sum of the energy it stole from them. \n\nThe exact method of this stealing process has not been found, but the investigations indicate that an infecting particle is somehow transferring the energetic spirit of any higher life form to a local pool of the entity. The local pools aggregate into 'Hive Nuclei'. When a Nucleus is strong enough, a local entity, referred to as 'hive mind' is created. This hive mind then tries to get in touch with other hive minds on nearby Nexus worlds. It also sends out ships that seed the 'Legacy particles' on new worlds.\n\nIt was found that the Legacy particle can only infect higher beings, but not animals or lower lifeforms. The particle does actually infect lower lifeforms, but dies without gaining control or being able to transform them. The controlling of infected higher lifeforms is a side effect, though. They are used as cannon fodder for the LEGACY. The hives are not weakened by killing these Infected. It only slows down the spread of the Legacy Particle. This knowledge was used by the Ghyst and the Xenu for the Infinite Life Forms (ILF) weapon (created by the Serdu), - after the destruction of several planets with conventional weapons did not succeed. \n\nThe ILF was deployed on many worlds, creating a myriad of unintelligent, lower lifeforms. The theory was that the LEGACY could be 'dried out' or at least distracted, while spending more and more effort to compensate for the loss of its Legacy Particles, while conventional weapons destroy their hives. This strategy seems to have been successful as the Legacy was pushed back to the edge of the galaxy. The War of Silence officially ended 900 years ago.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_CauaG,Zirax Empire,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_m0uq0,"The glorious Zirax Empire was founded about 800 years ago, after the treachery of the Talon led to a civil war. The Talon-Zirax assembly was dissolved as a result and the Zirax Empire was born. It was founded by the most influential houses of the Zirax: The Xenu, the Ghyst, Rados, Epsilon, Serdu and Abyssal. The first empress was a member of the house of Serdu. In the beginning, this changed with nearly each new royal election. The last two centuries, the empress has always been a member of the House of Abyssal, though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_qmmpq,The Talon Treachery (Empire Version),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_We0eQ,"Even before the War of Silence, the Zirax houses did all the dirty work for the Talon-Zirax assembly. When the War of Silence came to its end, evidence was found by the Xenu that the Talon might have initiated the war intentionally to weaken the houses and overtake the rulership. Ghyst specialists found out that the Talon were using similar tech than the ships of the LEGACY and that they seem to have come from the same spot outside of this galaxy. The high court of the houses decided that, after the dust of war settled down, to disempower these traitors for the good of all biological beings. \n\nMost of the Talon did not escape their deserved punishment and were enslaved or sent to reservations. There have been reports of a refugee fleet having fled into deep space. The glorious Zirax Empire is well aware about that and always ready to withstand their attack - or anyone else's.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_8a0WW,The Talon Treachery (additional info),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
pda_GGWuu,"Yeah, I had expected that you would find this questionable. But you need to know, the archive was created by my ancestors and only with the view of the glorious Empire in mind. Let me fill in some blanks and clarify a few details. \n\nThe 'evidence' the Xenu and the Ghyst found about the Talon having set up the War of Silence was already heavily disputed at that time. The specialist of the House of Abyssal later found out that the evidence was made up, faked or only half the truth. BUT, at this point no one did care, because the Houses have decided to take over the control. So they just used this reason - and everyone won. Except the Talon. A lot of the members of the Academy of Sciences were killed or imprisoned. But also a lot of the Talon, at least more than the Empire will admit, have fled into deep space. But never returned. \n\nOne thing of the evidence found back then seems to be correct: the Talon did use a similar tech than the LEGACY ships. Even the shapes of the ships were nearly identical. Also the weapons. And they came from a distant galaxy, Triangulum as you call it, as refugees as we found out. So there actually IS a connection between the Talon and the LEGACY. We just haven't found out what it is. I am feeling, we are so close...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They must have seen us coming down. We literally crashed on their front lawn. We are now heading towards the Talon settlement. The Zirax are on our heels, but seem to have lost interest .. or they are currently held up by the rest of the fleet. The last comm we got basically said the fleet is in retreat. The TITAN is lost, probably crashed on the Moon. Not sure if the crew survived. The MS GRAND has sent an encrypted signal which we hope the Zirax will not be able to decipher for a while. This is our ticket out of here. Some friends have put up a teleporter device in a wreckage area a few kilometers away. Emmerson, the lucky son of a .. , has generated a keycard. I am not sure if there are other ships coming down or other survivors. I'll leave a hint for those that might come later with instructions how to generate that keycard. For authentication, use 'AI Routine 34'. Otherwise the console will self-destruct instantly. If this plan fails, I advise every other survivor to go find one of the Talon villages.

This, after already working weeks with nearly no sleep. \n[[c][00ffff]M[-][/c]] That's obviously the risk of working in the expedition fleet, right? \n[[c][00ffff]L[-][/c]] Ha ha. Tell you what, this whole 'expedition' thing is going a strange route. Not to mention, there's a Council that governs all the decisions and the UCH is somehow in the dark. Don't you think this requires some additional ... explanation? \n[[c][00ffff]M[-][/c]] No. What should we explain? To whom? There is nothing secret about the expedition, for those that are involved. We'll tell the people what they need to know. \n[[c][00ffff]L[-][/c]] Yes. That's exactly my point! As you might know, my grandpa was the lead engineer on the Hyperion. He was not lost with the ship only for one simple reason: someone decided to reschedule his shift. I'm thankful for that, but my grandpa never managed to get rid of the stigma of 'the coward that was left behind'. \n[[c][00ffff]L[-][/c]] My dad moved to Mars with me after my grandpa's sudden death. I signed up for the fleet right after college, to show what our family is capable of. My dad said that Grandpa became crazy about this shit. Pretending the officials just want to silence everyone. Especially him personally, and the Hyperion Bereaved organization. All his stories of a 'planned accident.' The ship 'not being destroyed' and some 'threat' we are facing - all very dramatic. \n[[c][00ffff]L[-][/c]] And, to be honest, until the last 24h, I always thought this old poor man simply could not cope with what happened. When you showed up on board the Titan, I suddenly remembered one of my grandpa's stories, about some 'black suits' visiting the Hyperion a few days ahead of the mission. \n[[c][00ffff]M[-][/c]] Commander. Please... \n[[c][00ffff]L[-][/c]] No! Listen, Mercer. I've been working for this project for nearly eight years now, and in these last few months, I've looked at this project and I've done the math. In the last week, and in the last 24 h in particular, so many strange things have happened. \n[[c][00ffff]L[-][/c]] Did you know the GRAND and the TITAN each have several squads of marines on board? Sure you do. I checked the manifests yesterday. We have stashed away tons and tons and tons of high caliber ammo. I am an engineer. I know what these formulas and materials are made for. This is not for asteroid defense. So don't tell me this 'nothing is secret' bullshit. And now you are coming on board. And the first thing you do, is to mess around with the protocols I have been developing for the last five years. \n[[c][00ffff]M[-][/c]] Commander. Calm down please. The adjustments we've made have been derived from important data, coming directly from Apollon labs. Dr Greyson and Dr. Dawson? You might know them. \n[[c][00ffff]L[-][/c]] I do. But I have also looked at the changes you made. These are risky. I am not sure what they should do exactly. They don't seem to have any function that improves the efficiency of the warp drives. \n[[c][00ffff]M[-][/c]] Rest assured, these have been approved by top specialists, everything is fine. \n[[c][00ffff]L[-][/c]] Rest assured, that if something goes wrong .. and someone is harmed .. and I discover that it was because of your changes .. nothing will be fine ... for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

pda_Wqaql,"After we escaped with our bare lives, there was a lot of discussion about what the fleet should do next. The two Admirals, my father and anyone with any relevant info, was either lost or dead. And when our voyage started, everything was chaotic as well. \n\nAfter a few weeks it became clear, that we won't go back to earth anytime soon. So there was a fierce dispute on how to proceed. Although we had found a secret hiding place, some of the commanders and captains, led by Commander Lamarr, Commander Zerogen and others spoke to Vice Admiral Perez about supporting the local independence movement to find some allies and first and foremost gather more info that way, without running into the Zirax Empire again. \n\nBut Perez did not want to risk anything until we had built up a solid base of operations in that sector. She was also much more in favor of establishing the plans for the 'Project Eden'. Finding a planet for us to live on - or for others that might follow us to Andromeda now or in the future. \n\nAnyways. As a result, Commander Lamarr and the others left the fleet and started the GLaD. I think, as things stand now, Perez is quite happy about that, because GLaD helped to lead the Zirax forces astray several times already. So, after misconceptions were ruled out on both sides, GLaD is now secretly working with the UCH fleet, nurturing the resistance movement of the Talon against the Zirax and trying to get hands on any info about our fate and what the hell is going on in this galaxy. \n\nA short while ago, we actively tried to get in touch with you. Was quite a problem, but then one of our Talon agents managed to get hold of you. He was the guy upgrading your suit with our communication protocol. At the same time the Ilmarinen entered the sector and we found a way to implant an agent to the Polaris mining facility where the Staff of Guidance was found. \n\nAnd then .. here we are I think.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

pda_8KKOe,"The Talon seem to have been refugees, fleeing from the Triangulum galaxy. Fleeing from something what we know as 'The Legacy'. Still no idea what that exactly is, but it seems to be able to infect, control and even convert biological beings and machines. Pentaxid, the fuel of our warp drives and many other things, seems to play a role. The Ilmarinen, which you visited lately, was captured this way, when the unlucky crew dug up a part of an infected pentaxid asteroid and brought it on board. Bad idea. That's all we know about the Legacy so far. \n\nOn the Talon topic: Your latest information indicates, that after the Talon arrived in Andromeda, they fell back into barbary, but have made it back to space in a short amount of time. They found and raised the Zirax and because the Talon were more the brains than the muscles, the Zirax grew into the role of the latter. After some decades of peace, the War of Silence started when the Legacy managed to follow the Talon to Andromeda. \n\nWe do not yet know how this happened and also not how the war actually ended, but as far as we can say, the outcome was that the Talon were nearly eradicated from Andromeda. Not by the Legacy, but by the Zirax. That's where we still do not have a lot of information why this turned out as it did. You finding that cryogenized Talon prisoner named Kar'han indicates, that the Zirax turned against their century-long allies all of a sudden. \n\nWhat we also know is, that The Legacy was defeated, but not destroyed when the War of Silence ended. And it seems as thought that entity is coming back to live more and more. As you, and others, already found out first hand. \n\nTaking all that into account, there is one thing that does not make much sense at least to us: The Talon seem to still be technically capable of doing next-to-magical things, but those that are capable are hiding their knowledge even from their own tribes. We have now been working with them for nearly a year, but they still keep it a secret, why they do not use their abilities to their full extent. If you ask me, this is a bit suspicious.
