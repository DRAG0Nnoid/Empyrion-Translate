The Neptun-type planets are often called [-] but basically they are better categorized as [-] as one of their main components is water in a supercritical fluid state. They are also a different category of gas planets because, in contrast to Jupiter and Saturn types, their constituent compounds were solids when they formed. Some of those planets may still have a solid surface like other so called [-]. Their atmosphere is a lot different to any of these planets of course.[-]Primary gases: water (supercritical fluid state), ammonia, methane[-]Solid terrain: possible[-]Solid core: likely[-]Note: Currently it is not possible to land or fly into the atmosphere on any of the gas giants.[-].

Warp Arrival / Exit Sector (Sun).
An empty sector very close to the sun. Depending on which direction you came from, there are 6 possible exit points: front, back, up, down, left, right.[-]You will always exit your warp travel in one of them. [-]Important[-]: Make sure to NOT warp away leaving ships and vessels in your arrival sector - you will not be able to warp back from within the solar system to your arrival sector, due to gravitational and subspace effects!.
This barren, rocky planet, keeps nearest to its star... - Which is a bit too close for comfort. Its day side is heated near to the melting point, while the night side radiates into the vacuum of space. This constant temperature stress leaves deep scars in the surface, and fuels the growth of exotic crystals.[-]During youth, this world even had part of its crust boiled away - Placing the heavy mantle deposits in scanner range - ...

You might notice some interesting details when entering that sector which is said to be the Kriel Empires cradle. A nearly burnt out star and dead planets and moons, surrounded by dozens of heavily armed vessels, fortresses ... and stations filled with birth stations. You might not live long enough to ask any questions, though.[-]Radiation: 5-10[-]Temperature: -200 to -100[-]Resource Asteroids (Probability Factor - Count min/max)[-]- Iron (0.4, 1-2)[-]- Copper (0.4, 1-1)[-] - Silicon (0.4, 1-2)[-]- Magnesium (0.4, 1-1)[-]- Cobalt (0.4, 1-1)[-]- Neodymium (0.4, 1-1)[-]- Promethium (0.4, 1-1)[-]- Sathium (0.4, 1-1)[-]- Erestrum (0.1, 1-1)[-]- Zascosium (0.1, 1-1)[-]- Pentaxid (0.3, 1-1)[-]- Gold (0.3, 1-1) [-]- Titanium (0.5, 1-2).
It might be the birthplace of the Kriel as a race, but this dead planet is more a signal what the Kriel are up to: expand their territory at all cost..
This swamp planet has only very few signs of any civilization. It is not clear why, but the Zirax stripped the planet of nearly all buildings, except the palace of the empress and a few monasteries. This is the sanctum planet. The spiritual and secular center of the Empire..
Three words: Never. Land. There.[-]This planet has been seized by the remains of the reactivated LEGACY. The entity uses the pentaxid in its crust to transform the surface into something no one knows what it should stand for... or do..
Zirax Empire ( Fortress Moons ).
Kriel Empire ( Dumpster Moons ).
Covered in wreckages and garbage of all kinds, these  moons are the dumping sites in most of the Kriel controlled systems.  They are not well guarded and the Kriel have a very low threshold for things that they would throw away.  The risk of being caught while digging through the junk sites might sometimes be worth the reward....
The Fortress Moons are the fleet bases and garrisons of the Zirax Empire space and ground forces. You can find them in most of the systems that are controlled by the Empire. Expect lots of troops, transporters and heavy combat vessels. Military operations in the sector (or for several sectors) are coordinated from those moons. The stations are said to be equipped with long-range teleporters to allow the Zirax troops to be quickly sent to any hotspot in a few light years distance. [-]It is not advised to land on such a moon without an ambassador's permission..
A small planetary patrol drone that has the capability to stun/disable biological beings and do a lot of damage to energy shields. It does no damage to armor and only has weak armor. The drone series was a concept of an energy-based non-lethal patrol drone, but development has ceased in favor of improved high-caliber projectile weaponry for drones and fighters..
The miniguns of this planetary drone are a real danger for all ground troops, but not so much for armored vessels. Its armor is quite weak..
The 30mm projectiles of this planetary drone will do a lot of damage to light armored, slow moving vessels, but only minor to zero damage to shields. It is also slightly better armored than the minigun drones. Ground troops are in a real danger as well, although the rate of fire is low enough to be able to possibly outrun the drone..
The (non-guided) rockets of this planetary drone deal a lot of piercing and splash damage including a small EMP effect component. They are a real danger for medium armored vessels, although shields will take only a fraction of the damage per rocket. Ground troops should be able evade the rockets if the distance is high enough and when moving quickly enough. The rocket drones have light to medium armor..
The minigun gunship class is geared to combat entire groups of hostile ground troops at the same time. It still uses the 15mm rounds, but due to modifications to the guns, it might deal some damage to smaller, unshielded vessels as well..
The rocket gunship is heavily armed and uses a slightly larger rocket type than its smaller sibling. The damage to shields and armor plates has been further increased by weapon modifications and a higher rate of fire..
A heavily armed space fighter with good maneuverability, equipped with guided rockets. While the damage to armor has been improved, the rockets deal only slightly more damage to shields than the variant of the planetary drones..
The Kiuvera-class cutter is a state-of-the-art multi-role attack craft designed in the last few years after the Zirax encountered the UCH from studying the wreckage left from the battle over Akua.[-]Unlike older model zirax crafts, the cockpit is further forward with a wide wing-like fore instead of a heavily armored prow that would typically be used for ramming. The wing-like front stabilizes the craft and reduces strain on the ship's frame while entering atmosphere instead of simply forcing atmosphere out of the way with brute force.[-]The secondary purpose of the downward-curved wings is to function as supports as a dropship, capable of lifting ground vehicles and supplies long distance in-atmo for minimal fuel.[-]Unlike the Korat, the Kiuvera has interchangeable equipment, being easily refitted on the fly for patrol, bombing, surveillance and cargo. Making it a preferred patrol vessel for many of the zirax houses.[-]Attack value: [-]Defense value: [-]Weapons: 4x Laser[-]Shield:[-]Drones:.
