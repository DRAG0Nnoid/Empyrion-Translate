There isn[-]Elder Talon[-]Talon Guardian[-]Talon-Zirax Assembly', which persisted for hundreds of years. It is not known yet why it collapsed, why they separated, or if it was a conspiracy. Files retrieved by the 2nd UCH recon unit indicated that the abominations found on the planets they occupied, seemed to have something to do with this or at least are related to a big incident in the past. These files were encrypted, classified and could not be deciphered until today. Their brutality and behavior towards the Talon or anyone not from a Zirax controlled faction, indicates that there is a lot more to uncover, than official reports tell us at the moment..
