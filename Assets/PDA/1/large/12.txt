[-]We always assume that evolution in the universe follows the same rules, so there is a high chance that we do not see anything extraordinary when looking to the stars. Of course, the chances that we are wrong, are equally high. [-]Ernest Jakkard, Sc.D UCH Xenobiological Research Facility 2468 AD [-]--- [-]To show all topics of this guide, click the DROPDOWN ARROW of this chapters HEADLINE in the list on the left! Click the SUB-task to reveal the info contained. Make sure the PDA INFO button on the TOP RIGHT of the screen is selected![-].
[-]Your suit will automatically test and categorize any biological and non-biological item according to similarities found with earth organisms with the built-in xenobiological testing procedure. [-]This means: Even if an item might look different or drop from a plant that does not even remotely look earth-like, anything you can harvest from a plant will be categorized into [-]Nutrition Groups[-] and displayed as: Plant Protein, Natural Sweetener, Grain, Berries, Fruit, Mushroom, Natural Stimulant, Vegetables, Spice, Buds.[-] [-]Medical ingredients[-] are displayed as: Herbal Leaves, Confetti Moss Scrapings, Fire Moss Scrapings, Alien Tooth, Alien Parts, Alien Plasma T6, Alien Plasma ZR1, Alien Thorn[-] [-]Note: Eating ingredients or raw food has a risk of getting you an Indigestion!.
[-]Sprouts are created in the food processor from an item/crop of the plant and Nutrient Solution. Example: Plant Protein + Nutrient Solution will give you an Ahax Sprout.[-].
[-]Oxygen: Always required [-]No O2 = [-]Plant will stop growing[-]Temperature: 15-35°C | lower 0 or higher than 50 = [-]Plant will die[-] [-]Radiation: 0[-] | RAD higher than 3 = [-]Plant will die[-].
[-]- Base / Vessel needs to be powered | No Power = [-]Plant will stop growing[-] [-]- Inside a base or Vessel you need a GROWING LIGHT. Place it on the ceiling with exactly 2 blocks in between the top side of the growing plot and the ceiling where the Growing Light is placed [-]- A growing light can support 3x3 growing plots at max when placed at the ceiling in the center spot of this array. [-]- If the outside conditions meet the Growing Conditions, you can set up a farm without a growing light on the outside. In this case OUTSIDE = open to the sky with no roof (includes NO windows).
[-]For most of the items, protocols allow to [-]alternatively craft them from different ingredients[-] as well. [-]For example: Milk, Meat, Plant Protein and most of the Medical ingredients like Scrapings, Alien Parts and Plasma can be converted from substitutes![-].
