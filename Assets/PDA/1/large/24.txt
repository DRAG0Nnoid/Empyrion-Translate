Most devices and blocks cost CPU points when added to a vessel or structure. To check the requirements of a device, have a look at its hover info card.[-]A structure/vessel has a limit of how many CPU points you can spend on its devices per CPU TIER. [-]You can increase the CPU points pool by installing CPU EXTENDERS, which increases your CPU TIER.[-]You can keep adding devices [-] even in case your CPU points on your actual CPU TIER are used up BUT this will reduce the overall CPU EFFICIENCY of some devices, like weapons, thrusters etc. What means you will fly slower, for example. [-]CPU Tiers are not a hard limit, though.[-]Check the STATISTICS page in the Control Panel for detailed info about CPU Tier levels, points and Efficiency![-]Knowledge:[-]- Maintaining the 100% CPU performance gives you some benefits, like increased thruster performance.[-]- Dropping below the 100% efficiency will increase penalties the same way, for example reduced generator output, down to a point where your base or vessel becomes fully dysfunctional![-]- CPU Extenders do not remove the requirement of a CORE![-]- To unlock a CPU Tier you need to place ALL Extenders of the TIER you want to use.[-] - If you have one or several additional Tiers completed and you LOSE a device from the highest  (working) Tier-level (f.ex in combat), you drop back to the NEXT lower (completed) Tier[-]- Losing a CPU Tier will also remove the CPU Points available and thus possibly lower the Efficiency of your vessel[-]Tip: Having LOWER CPU tiers in your vessel or base will work as a FALLBACK. When a higher Tier is lost you do not drop to T1, but maybe only to the next lower tier (which means the Efficiency of your affected base or vessel is not decreased too much).
If your base is too close or even inside an enemy faction's territory, the chance is high that it will send troops to tear down your base. The more dangerous you are considered by a faction, the heavier the attack will hit.[-]You can check the threat level in the control panel of a base:[-]1. Open the control panel (P)[-]1. Go to the STATISTICS tab[-]2. Look at the BASE ATTACK info card on the lower right[-]The Base Attack info will tell you WHICH base from a certain faction is currently coordinating the attacks.[-]When this command center is destroyed, and given there are not multiple command centers, the attacks will end on this planet.[-]Knowledge:[-]A faction can have several command centers. You need to destroy all to end the attacks on a planet..
Cruise Mode (CTRL + W).
In order to maintain speed, hold CTRL + W until the cruise control arrow is at the top.[-]You can then work on other things while the vessel flies into the chosen direction..
As soon as you are in range of a Logistic Network or standing on your base or vessel, you can access the new logistic menu with F4 - or by facing a container and clicking F[-]On BOTH SIDES  you can select[-]- a structure (even the same structure)[-]- a container (cannot be the same if structure is the same)[-]On the RIGHT side you can also select Fuel Tanks and O2 Tanks from an additional dropdown in order to fill them (fill-source needs to be selected to the LEFT side!)[-]The MIDDLE offers several buttons[-]- Connect Toolbar[-]- Find Constructor (assigned to the container on the right)[-]- Move all items left/right.
As indicated, the integration of weight and volume limits will change how you handle blocks and items - especially the big ones: Large Constructor has 2500 L volume and your Inventory has 500 L storage capacity.[-]1. As soon as you are  in range of the Logistic Network, hit F4 and use the CONNECT button in the Logistic menu.[-]2. Now, you get a new toolbar, the CONNECTED TOOLBAR, which is pulled to the foreground automatically. (Switch between manual and connected toolbar with T)[-]3. Drag and drop large blocks to this connected toolbar.[-]This will [-] add the block or device to the toolbar and let you use it from there like you would from your manual toolbar, except volume and weight limits do not play a role there..

- The WIRELESS  CONTROL block will EXTEND the range of the Logistic menu up to 100m FROM ITS VERY POSITION! [-]- Check the lower left icon row: when the  Wireless Control NETWORK symbol lights up, you are in range of a structure with a Wireless Control device[-]- You can add more than ONE Wireless Control device per structure. Set them to the edges to max out the range.[-]- A number next to the Wireless Control Network symbol indicates that there might be more than  one structures available[-]- You can only connect to ONE structure/container combo at the same time![-]- You do NOT have to have any weapon or drill or tool in the CONNECTED TOOLBAR to move items over the Logistic Network connection. You simply need to be CONNECTED to a receiver structure![-]- When you get out of range, you need to get back, open F4 and reconnect manually (there is no automated reconnect at the moment)[-]- The Portable Constructor has NO Logistic Network at the moment, so if you decide to test volume limits enabled, you currently will not be able to place a large constructor for your base (and other blocks/devices).
- When mining cooperatively it can happen in rare cases that, although you are connected to a Logistic Network, items might drop to the ground. This can happen as the storage-method cannot move items in  a container in the EXACT same second for several players. If the container is blocked in that very second, a picked up item might get dropped in front of you.[-]- There is currently a limit that the Network cannot relay beyond the grid size of 500m AND if you place a wireless network block in [-] only the 1st WiFi Block within 100m from the edge of the base will relay the signals. So the MAX-range is 200m  for connected build.
The items and blocks you put in the connected toolbar will actually be removed from the connected container inventory[-]When you get out of range (walk away from the base), the connected toolbar will get suspended and the items stored there will [-] to the source container. You need to get back in range, manually reconnect to the container again and move the items to your toolbar once again (This setup is NOT stored and reconnected automatically!)[-]Cooperative Play[-]Another player can connect to the SAME structure/container combination and also drag blocks to his connected toolbar.[-]While still only ONE player can actually open the container (have its GUI open) at any time, several players can always use these connections for cooperative build that way, as long as everyone has the Logistic Menu closed after having connected![-]The CONNECTED TOOLBAR is not a workaround to circumvent volume and weight limits. It is PRIMARILY a toolbar to allow building without having run back and forth between containers due to the volume limits or be able to build at all and will stay in the future iterations, as most of the mid game blocks and devices are too heavy or voluminous for you to carry around in your backpack!.
Container Controller / Expansion.
The modular container system allows to create storage space in various custom shapes up to a fixed volume/count per unit.[-]Each Container module consist of a[-]- Container Control Unit (CC, max one per container)[-]- Cargo Expansion Unit (CE)[-]CE/CC are available for standard containers, ammo and harvesting containers.  [-]Howto[-]:[-]Place the CC and add CEs or place CEs and add a CC - this works either way round.[-]You can of course assign the modular containers to any Constructors as well. The mechanic is the same as for standalone containers (you need to assign the CC, as the CE will not be visible in any GUI)[-]Handling notes:[-]- You cannot add 2 CCs to the same modular container[-]- Destroying or removing the CC will eject all the items[-]- Destroying or removing an individual CE will eject all the items of the affected CE volume[-]- If the available volume drops below the cargo content required, stacks will NOT be split (only full stacks are dropped!). So if there is one stack with 999 items and the only way is to get below the threshold by ejecting most items of this stack, the game will not just take the amount required, but eject the full stack at the moment.  [-]- If you want to place 2 modular containers side by side you need to leave a gap of 1 block between both (eg. you cannot have 2 Modular containers [-] each other)[-]- The CEs have a range of available building shapes. Highlight the CE in your toolbar and hit RMB to open the shape menu.
In case you are trying to fly a vessel which has other vessels undocked inside or very close, the movement will be blocked/slowed down..
