United Council of Humanity (UCH ).
Galactic Liberation and Defense (GLD).
Summary[-]The UCH was founded as a NGO back in the early 22nd century to research the predicted collapse of the Terran ecosystem. By the end of the 24th century, after the wars and catastrophic events leading into the [-] calmed down more and more, the UCH was re-founded as kind of a worldwide government by the surviving nations and local governments. Power was granted to the UCH authority to take care of the survival of the Terran civilization.[-]History[-]With the discovery of the alien ship in 2402 AD, the dark era for mankind ended all of a sudden. The UCH, founded nearly a century before, was able to use the find and retrieve most of the technological knowledge buried in the ice of Antarctica. This phase did not last very long as this new technology required some materials that were not obtainable in earth[-]Empyrion' used loosely throughout history is a physical location or a spiritual/philosophical belief..
Summary[-]The Galactic Liberation and Defense group has strong relationships to the UCH. It is said that some of the personnel of the former Operation Phoenix fleet have joined their ranks. The purpose of the group is to support the Talon against the Zirax oppression. There are more but yet revealed reasons for this group to exist, though..
[-]The Ziraxian Empire is a militarist oligarchy and the largest power in the galaxy Andromeda. It is ruled by a series of houses, each with a specific function or functions that relates to a sphere of influence. These houses each produce a representative at an, as yet, undiscovered time, and they form a council of elders. This production is facilitated by the Empress who publicly holds supreme power, but is possibly more a figure head.[-]Expand folder to read more[-].
[-]The Talon are an astonishingly primitive society with little variation. They seem to have [-]abandoned all technological advancements - for some unknown reason.[-] The Zirax impose a heavy toll upon the Talon  – zealously sheltering them with drones and other restraints. This may indicate either the Talon pose a threat to them… or are kept hostages for some unknown reason.[-].
