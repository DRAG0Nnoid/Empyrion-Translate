[-] [-]Me[-] Ok, new idea - you will stay here on the console and I will go down to the control core and reboot the whole thing. If that doesn't work... [-]K[-] It better should!

The Operation Phoenix Fleet dropped out of hyperspace in an unknown solar system on July 26, 2473, and was immediately attacked by Zirax forces. The transporter UCH Heidelberg was shot down, but there were several survivors. A few of them left messages for the player to find in certain places. Those messages should give him a first idea about what happened to the fleet and where to start searching for survivors.[-]While examining the crashed vessel, you find indications that you did not arrive WITH the fleet, but lost 1 year for some unknown warp-drive-jump-gone-wrong reasons while you were dragged into the warp-vortex of the TITAN and the Operation Phoenix fleet. [-]You are actually in the year 2474.[-]This chapters logs and messages are setting up the basic storyline for all UCH-related missions.[-].
