Other than for RCS devices, the calculation of thruster-torque depends on a lot of factors ( inertia tensor of the ship, the positions and orientations of all the thrusters of the ship compared its the center of mass,..etc) BUT information about what amount of torque is contributed by RCS and/or Thrusters is available in the STATISTIC tab of the control panel.[-]Important NOTE: [-]The thrust-torque always generates in relation to the planes created by the different axis spread from the CENTER OF MASS, not anything else! [-]What means: [-]Thrusters generate rotation around the two axes perpendicular to the thruster direction, with a strength proportional to the thrusters' distance from the center of mass. Ships always rotate around their center of mass.[-]Example: [-]If your thrusters you use to produce a Yaw are not exactly in the horizontal plane containing the center of mass, then this will generate mostly a Yaw but also some small Pitch and some Small Roll. If the ship is not able to cancel those other unwanted rotations (here Pitch and Roll) with some other thrusters it will cancel the rotation and not turn..
Aerodynamics can be used to build plane-style vessels that work in atmospheres with only a back-facing thruster (and a forward facing for braking!)[-]The mechanic is pretty straight forward:[-]As long as the ground-facing surface of your vessel is large/big enough, it might create enough uplift to allow your vessel to be leveled with the horizon and NOT drop to the grown as you are moving forward fast enough. (This is NOT a full real-world simulation of course!)[-]If you vessel is heavy and you are going too slow and the shape is not really optimal (although you will not need a wing-only style vessel to make this work!!) you will not achieve the same performance and possibly drop to the ground..
[-]Tips[-]- Spreading out the thruster from the center of mass of the vessel will increase the torque![-]  - Depending in which direction the thruster points and where it is placed, it will add its torque to roll, yaw or pitch[-]  - Unlike the BOOST, torque will be added by ANY thruster (JET and Standard)[-]- You do NOT need an RCS to roll or pitch or yaw your vessel! (Also saves CPU points).
The VIRTUAL DRAG, although it will have a lot of impact on the TOP SPEED (not to confuse with the TECHNICAL max speed of the vessel class; see explanation above) of your vessel and depends a lot on how you shape your vessel, is the feature that possibly requires the least of explanations.[-]The system is very simple and can be put in between these two extremes:[-]  - If your vessel is build more like an arrow, you might be able to rise the TOP SPEED of your vessel up to the TECHNICAL MAX SPEED of your vessel type just by building and with only few thrusters.[-]  - If you build a flying brick, the TOP SPEED of your vessel might not even be close to the TECHNICAL MAX SPEED of your vessel type and you might need to reduce mass or increase thrust.[-]This accounts for ALL movement directions, as well as for roll/yaw/pitch![-]Virtual drag takes into account the overall shape of the vessel.[-]The Virtual Drag values are  visualized on the STATISTIC page or - together with the other flight mechanic values - on a dedicated, new Control Panel tab.
[-]Why is it called VIRTUAL DRAG?[-]Because it is NOT the physical (aerodynamic) drag alone, but a combination of a lot of factors. The term [-] is a hand term to describe the methods and factors used to define the TOP SPEED of your vessel (which might not necessarily range up to the technical max speed of the vessel type)![-]For example in space the single factor [-], that you only have in an atmosphere, is of course not present, but other factors like mass and thruster capability are still weighted in.[-]Why is this also affecting ships in space?[-]The VIRTUAL DRAG to some extent compensates for the inevitable technical limitations of the game environment and engine. Also, as we do NOT want Empyrion to be a physics simulation, we cannot fully use real world physics and mechanics, for example thrust power, mass, volumes etc. [-]By limiting the technical max speed, we have to find a middle ground between technical possibilities and a gameplay that is fun but not too simplified. The VIRTUAL DRAG (As well as other features) add a new challenge in terms of an additional balancing parameter -  which can be overcomed either by building and design or by using CPU Points in terms of investing in thrust or RCS..
With the Logistics Network (F4) you can transfer goods and items between your vessels, base and your personal inventory without having to manually approach the containers (or sometimes you don't even need to move your vessel)[-]Add a WIRELESS CONNECTION device to your bases and vessels to increase the range of the Logistics Network up to about 100m[-]As long as you are in range of your structures logistic network, you can use ANYTHING from the connected toolbar as you would from your default toolbar.[-]For more detail and info, please, in the list on the left, click and open this chapters sub-headlines by [-]clicking on their headline[-] and/or by clicking the [-]arrow-buttons [-]next to them.[-].
Crafting / Constructor Setup.
[-]Important: check the HELP button in the device window for any info on how to manage and work with the devices named below!![-]There are three basic variants of construction/crafting machines available for vessels and bases[-]- Constructors (incl. Food Processor)[-]- Deconstructors[-]- Furnace[-]Note: [-]- For most of these, you need to assign a Cargo Box or Container for the devices to work! [-]- Read the LOGISTICS entry to learn about how to use the Logistics Network to manage and handle large devices or craft/manage your production from remote or between vessels and structures![-]For more detail and info, please, in the list on the left, click and open this chapters sub-headlines by [-]clicking on their headline[-] and/or by clicking the [-]arrow-buttons [-]next to them.[-].
Assign & use Containers for production.
Applies to Constructor, Deconstructor, Furnace and Food Processor![-]1. Click on the dropdown next to the INPUT on the left of the constructor screen and select a container to connect the production logistics.[-]2. In order to ADD resources to an INBOX container while you are in the constructor screen, click on the small icon next to the source dropdown to access the Logistics Network! The connected container will be listed with an (A) in front of its name.[-]Do the same for picking up crafted devices and items from the OUTBOX.[-]This is required, because you cannot directly grab produced items from the OUTPUT in the Constructor screen and you cannot simply drop items into the INPUT..
1. You can have different containers for inbox and outbox! The constructor will automatically pick from or move items and devices to the assigned container(s).[-]2. When you reach a high enough level in the tech tree, you can also craft an Expandable Container System. [-]You need to craft one [-] (CC) main unit and place it. Then craft [-] (CE) and place them adjacent to the Container Controller to expand this controller's capacity.[-]3. You can manage ALL of your containers and cargo and even your constructors with the Logistics Network. Step on your base or in range of a Wireless Device and hit F4 to access the network.[-]4. Filling the Container of a constructor does not require doing this from inside the constructor GUI. You can use the Logistic Menu, find the container you used for Input and/or Output and add or remove items and blocks at any time. You can even for example [-] into this container while the constructor works on the ingots.[-]5. As long as you (or someone else) accesses an assigned container or adds something in the same second (e.g mining in ores), the construction process will be halted and resumed.[-]6. You actually CAN assign the outbox-assigned Container of a Constructor as the INBOX for another constructor and so on!.
You can build Teleporters for Base and Capital Vessels.[-]Base Teleporters have a range of up to 30 LY[-]Capital Vessel Teleporters can teleport inside a Sector[-]- Accessing a teleporter (F) will show you a range of available targets, faction status of the target, distance etc.[-]- You can teleport to any base you discovered, as long as the faction it owns is at least friendly to you.[-]- You can teleport to and from your ship, as long as it is not moving.[-]- You can not teleport from a ship or base that has its shields activated or is under attack. [-]- You actually can teleport to a destination where the teleporter is OFF.[-]Teleporter UI shows all NPC target stations in an [-] range (actual range + X) but does not allow teleportation if the targets are out of range of your current teleporter. This should serve as a info about sectors/systems that are only slightly out of reach.[-]Creators info:[-] [-]  - Only teleporters set to the [-] will allow players to select a target[-]  - If you do not want that and for POIs you want to assign teleporters to a specific location or no be available to players from the outside, uncheck the Teleport Network in the device. [-]  - Syntax for setting a defined teleporter destination:[-]DeviceName@StructureName:PlayfieldName@SolarSystemName#Origin[-]Note: This does NOT apply for targets that are instances as they get loaded all the time. [-]  Note: This syntax does NOT apply to the teleporters players can build in survival!.
