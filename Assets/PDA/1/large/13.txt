[-]The Universe is full of dangers, and wonders, and wonderful dangers!

1. All the faction-assignments below apply to wandering NPCs and Patrols at all times (does NOT depend on the faction territory!) [-]2. If an NPC is spawned in a POI, the origin of the NPC is defined by the faction of the POI, EXCEPT the creator of the POI has set a different origin for the to-be-spawned NPC (what is possible in the NPC Spawn setup dialogue!) [-]3. Turret targeting info, regarding NPC factions: [-]- All NPC factions members ( Zrx, Pol, Tal) apply to the [-] checkbox, either in a POI or when wandering around! [-]- Turrets will not attack Zrx, Pol and Tal if you are on NEUTRAL standing or better, even WHEN the checkbox for NPC factions is ticked! [-]- LEGACY (Global [-] Faction) creatures will be attacked only when PREDATOR checkbox is ticked, as Aln is not a real NPC faction (you cannot change your standing; always HOSTILE) [-]- Prey and Predator are no NPC factions. That's why they have their own targeting setting..
