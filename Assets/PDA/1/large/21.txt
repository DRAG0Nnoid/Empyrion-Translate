The natural evolution of the Infector-class legacy biocraft. The Decimator is the unfurled shell state with enhanced armaments and a chambered carapace. Evolution of traits borne to counteract the armor-piercing weapons of the zirax during the War of Silence.[-]Despite losing the ability to drop from orbit as Infectors do, (the effects of this event with a Decimator-class ship resulted in the entity breaking up on impact with the ground. With the entity damaged beyond recovery 60% of the time.) they were typically found as a rear guard for the Infectors in planetary assaults or as protection for Hiveships.[-]An Infector-class biocraft that has successfully landed and absorbed natural materials, will in many cases transition into a Decimator, rise into orbit and assume the task of supporting invasion with new infectors on another location. Had the War of Silence dragged on longer, the number of Decimators found on the battlefield would've eventually surpassed the zirax fleet in number.[-]Attack Value: [-]Defense Value: [-]Weapon types: Anti-Proton beam[-]Shield:[-]Drones:.
A drone of the TESCH collective. It is used on planets and in orbit. It is unknown which weapons are used, but is very similar to the LEGACY Anti-Proton beam weapons..

Vessels and stations that are either privately held or belong to independent companies often have running contracts with the big factions, like Zirax Empire, Kriel Empire, Traders Guild and Polaris Megacorp as well as the Colonists and DESC. Smugglers handling stuff for the Pirate Clans or everyone who can pay them, can be found as well.[-]In this case, the vessels, escorting drones and stations listed below will have their faction color and tags set to the company, faction or individual they are running a business for.[-]How they behave towards you is based on your reputation to the faction, company or individual they are currently working for.[-]Note on escorting DRONES: Due to the fact the freighters are often hired by factions and companies, the escorting drones might be of a different kind than the drones usually used by the hiring faction/company. This depends on the expenses the owner of the freighter has made or drones that he could acquire or was given..

[-]Constructed by Forge Aerospace's Anvil, the UCH 002 TITAN class ships were designated UCH fleet flagships, capable of housing almost 200 crew and multiple crafts, with advanced weaponry - compared to the technical level of the other terran vessels based in the solar system. The GRAND has been upgraded with more powerful tech found and acquired in Andromeda, though.[-]Despite the size of the ship, it remains a highly maneuverable heavy cruiser with enough computing power capable to handle a much larger array of additional armaments beyond standard at designated hardpoints all over the ship.[-]Attack Value: [-]Defense Value: [-]Weapon types: [-]Shields:[-]Drones:.

Indestructible blocks, devices and structures.
Player Spawn / Respawn.
There are two variants:[-]1. Default Core: armored blocks[-]Handheld weapons often cannot damage or even destroy blocks of Capital Vessels and Bases. A notification on the top center will inform you about that.[-]2. Admin Core[-]Some bases, mostly POIs might use an [-]. When you look at the map, this is indicated by a [-] icon instead of the rounded one.[-] Admin cores make all blocks and devices indestructible for any weapon EXCEPT those that have been set to be [-] by the creator of the POI. [-] There is one important premise for the default game: In case an admin-core station can shoot at you, turrets and relevant devices can always be destroyed. A station with an admin core which does NOT shoot at you (and which is NOT a Trading Station), is either a Dungeon or a Story-relevant POI.  But: Most of the time there is still a method for the core to be destroyed by the player. For example a lever or a puzzle or a riddle that will blast the core when solved. Without  a core, all the blocks and devices are destructible again!.
