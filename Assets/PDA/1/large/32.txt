[-]Command Meeting Room [-]T minus 23:02:13 [-]Admiral Yaden [-]Vice Admiral Benner [-]Commander Mercer [-]===[-]Y[-] Hello, Mr. Mercer. The Council is sending you over for another last minute stress test? [-]M[-] Admiral. Vice Admiral. [-]Bn[-] Please have a seat, Mercer. [-]M[-] Thanks, Vice Admiral. [-]Y[-] So..? Why are we meeting here? Has the start been postponed again? [-]M[-] No Sirs. The opposite has happened. The scheduled start has been set to 1600. Tomorrow. [-]Y[-] What? Mercer! Can you please tell the Council, that this is at least 24h too early? The warp drives are not ready. Not to mention all the other stuff that is missing... [-]M[-] I am afraid, the countdown has already started. The other commanders will be informed in an hour about the new schedule. I checked the status of all ships. We should be ready, even for this accelerated schedule. [-]Bn[-] I just checked the new mission parameters. All shore leaves have been canceled. The personnel on Apollon station, Titan station and the marine bases will be sent to the transports in the next 12h. Seems there is no way back, hmm? [-]M[-] No. The time window of the [-] is set and will be open only for a minute, perhaps less. [-]Y[-] Ok. Then, so be it. We knew this could happen. [-]Y[-] Mr. Benner, please commence the start protocols. [-]Bn[-] Aye, Sir. [-]Y[-] Mr. Mercer, we have installed the control station you requested. It is locked with your credentials. [-]M[-] Thanks, Sir. [-]Y[-] THEIA! Condition yellow at 10 00 tomorrow morning. [-]THEIA[-] Affirmative, Sir. [-]Y[-] Ok, gentlemen, let[-]s history!.
[-]Mission Planning Room [-]T minus 8:02:13 [-]Lt. Commander Lamarr [-]Lt. Commander Zerogen [-]===[-]L[-] Jennifer, did your team already set up the reworked warp cage for the new schedule? These guys are crazy. Rescheduling the start to 24h earlier...[-]Z[-] They literally threw me out of my bed in the middle of the night. But yes, we managed to get this done just a few minutes before your arrival. [-]Z[-] Hey, ... before I forget, there is a new guy on the bridge ... Mencer? Mirse? Mercer? not exactly sure. Black suit. Spooky guy. [-]L[-] Hmm ... I sense some trouble, but no real surprise. The whole project has gone a strange route. Don[-]s joke. [-]L[-] Absolutely. And.. why do we need those turrets and even combat ships? And Marines? And fighters? All docked in two clusters around the two ships going to Proxima Centauri for a warp drive test and resource gathering? [-]L[-] Feels like the Admirals want to invade a solar system. Like in the old star combat movies we watched last week. [-]Z[-] OK, I[-]May the thought be with you.[-]ll check the settings with the AI in the next few hours. Good night! [-]Z[-] Good night. See you later on the bridge. [-]L[-] THEIA! Can you please try to sync the incoming waves with the modules to 0.2? We should try to minimize any signal loop, or any external disturbance will make this whole thing either a giant heater ... or an uncontrollable wave skimmer. [-]THEIA[-] Of course, Commander. Adjustments are in the works..
[-]Warp Core Control Room [-]T minus 5:02:13 [-]Commander Lamarr [-]Commander Mercer [-]===[-]M[-] Hello, Commander Lamarr! [-]L[-] Oh, hello Commander Mercer. Nice to have you here. I[-]t mind? These black suits ... is this kind of an uniform? [-]M[-] That[-]s obviously the risk of working in the expedition fleet, right? [-]L[-] Ha ha. Tell you what, this whole [-] thing is going a strange route. Not to mention, there[-]t you think this requires some additional ... explanation? [-]M[-] No. What should we explain? To whom? There is nothing secret about the expedition, for those that are involved. We[-]s exactly my point! As you might know, my grandpa was the lead engineer on the Hyperion. He was not lost with the ship only for one simple reason: someone decided to reschedule his shift. I[-]the coward that was left behind[-]s sudden death. I signed up for the fleet right after college, to show what our family is capable of. My dad said that Grandpa became crazy about this shit. Pretending the officials just want to silence everyone. Especially him personally, and the Hyperion Bereaved organization. All his stories of a [-] The ship [-] and some [-] we are facing - all very dramatic. [-]L[-] And, to be honest, until the last 24h, I always thought this old poor man simply could not cope with what happened. When you showed up on board the Titan, I suddenly remembered one of my grandpa[-]black suits[-]ve been working for this project for nearly eight years now, and in these last few months, I[-]ve done the math. In the last week, and in the last 24 h in particular, so many strange things have happened. [-]L[-] Did you know the GRAND and the TITAN each have several squads of marines on board? Sure you do. I checked the manifests yesterday. We have stashed away tons and tons and tons of high caliber ammo. I am an engineer. I know what these formulas and materials are made for. This is not for asteroid defense. So don[-]nothing is secret[-]ve made have been derived from important data, coming directly from Apollon labs. Dr Greyson and Dr. Dawson? You might know them. [-]L[-] I do. But I have also looked at the changes you made. These are risky. I am not sure what they should do exactly. They don't seem to have any function that improves the efficiency of the warp drives. [-]M[-] Rest assured, these have been approved by top specialists, everything is fine. [-]L[-] Rest assured, that if something goes wrong .. and someone is harmed .. and I discover that it was because of your changes .. nothing will be fine ... for you..
[-]Captains Room [-]T minus 2:02:13 [-]Captain Benner [-]Commander Mercer [-]Ensign Adams [-]===[-]A[-] Sir, we are picking up strange signals from Apollon Station. The station AI is also not responding to our calls! [-]Bn[-] Any additional Information? [-]A[-] No sir. No contact possible. [-]Bn[-] Thanks, Adams. [-]Bn[-] THEIA! Set alert condition Orange. [-]Bn[-] Ensign! Please return to your station! [-]Bn[-] THEIA! Status of the fleet? [-]THEIA[-] All vessels are ready for departure. 99% of personnel boarded [-]Bn[-] 99% ? [-]THEIA[-] The transports from Apollon Station have not yet arrived. Specifically, Dr. Greyson, Dr. Dawson and Commander Henricks have not yet arrived, in addition to others. [-]THEIA[-] I have no contact with any of them. DAVE is no longer responding. [-]Bn[-] Mercer? [-]M[-] No contact. We must wait, as the schedule demands. [-]Bn[-] This is risky, you know? [-]M[-] Yes, I know exactly what you mean..
