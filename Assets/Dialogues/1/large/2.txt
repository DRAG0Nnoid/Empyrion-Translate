[-] Command Meeting Room [-] T minus 23:02:13 [-] Admiral Yaden[-] Vice Admiral Benner [-] Commander Mercer [-] [-] Hello, Mr. Mercer. [-] The Council is sending you over for another last minute stress test? [-] [-] Admiral. [-] Vice Admiral. [-] [-] Please have a seat, Mercer. [-] [-] Thanks, Vice Admiral. [-] [-] So..? [-] Why are we meeting here? [-] Has the start been postponed again? [-] [-] No Sirs. [-] The opposite has happened. [-] [-] [-]The scheduled start has been set to 1600. [-] Tomorrow. [-] [-] What? [-] Mercer! [-] Can you please tell the Council, that this is at least 24h too early? [-] The warp drives are not ready. [-] Not to mention all the other stuff that is missing... [-] [-] I am afraid, the countdown has already started. [-] The other commanders will be informed in an hour about the new schedule. [-] I checked the status of all ships. [-] We should be ready, even for this accelerated schedule. [-] [-] I just checked the new mission parameters. [-] All shore leaves have been canceled. [-] The personnel on Apollon station, [-] Titan station and the marine bases will be sent to the transports in the next 12h. [-] Seems there is no way back, hmm? [-] [-] No. [-] The time window of the 'Event' is set and will be open only for a minute, perhaps less. [-] [-] Ok. [-] Then, so be it. [-] We knew this could happen. [-] [-] [-]Mr. Benner, [-] please commence the start protocols. [-] [-] Aye, Sir. [-] [-] Mr. Mercer, [-] we have installed the control station you requested. [-] It is locked with your credentials.[-] [-] Thanks, Sir. [-] [-] THEIA! [-] Condition yellow at 10 00 tomorrow morning. [-] [-] [-]Affirmative, Sir. [-] [-] Ok, gentlemen, [-] let's add a new chapter to mankind's history!.

Mission Planning Room [-] [-]T minus 8:02:13 [-] [-]Commander Lamarr [-] [-]Lt.Commander Zerogen [-] [-] Jennifer, did your team already set up the reworked warp cage for the new schedule? [-] These guys are crazy. [-] Rescheduling the start to 24h earlier...[-] [-] They literally threw me out of my bed in the middle of the night. [-] But yes, we managed to get this done just a few minutes before your arrival. [-] [-] Hey, ... [-] before I forget, [-] there is a new guy on the bridge ... [-] Mencer? [-] Mirse? [-] Mercer? [-] Not exactly sure. [-] Black suit. [-] Spooky guy. [-] [-] Hmm ... [-] I sense some trouble. [-] The whole project has gone a strange route. [-] Do you remember when we were college students? [-] When the first team started after the Hyperion was lost? [-] Analyze the incident. [-] Build a new science vessel. [-] We can do it better.. [-] blah blah .. [-] all those pathetic speeches? [-] [-] We had a test about the Hyperion Incident and what followed from it in our science class in college. [-] If I would have known that, [-] after I signed up 5 years ago, [-] that they are building a fleet.. [-] with only two functional warpdrives! [-] I would have taken it for an April Fool's joke. [-] [-] [-] Absolutely. [-] And.. [-] why do we need those turrets and even combat ships? [-] And Marines? [-] And fighters? [-] For a warp drive test and resource gathering in Proxima Centauri? [-]  Feels more like the Admirals want to invade a solar system. [-] Like in the old star combat movies we watched last week. [-] [-] If it's like that, I'd better get some sleep. [-] 'May the thought be with you.' [-] [-] [-]Haha.. [-] Send your colleagues to the cabins as well. [-] You and your team have achieved something next to impossible in the given timeframe. [-] I'll check the settings with the AI in the next few hours. [-] Good night! [-] [-] [-]THEIA! [-] Can you please try to sync the incoming waves with the modules to 0.2? [-] We should try to minimize any signal loop, [-] or any external disturbance will make this whole thing either a giant heater ... [-] or an uncontrollable wave skimmer. [-] [-] Of course, Commander. [-] Adjustments are in the works..

Warp Core Control Room[-] T minus 5:02:13[-] Commander Lamarr [-] Commander Mercer [-] [-] Hello, Commander Lamarr![-] [-] Oh, hello Commander Mercer. [-] Nice to have you here. [-]  I've heard you are now responsible for the warp engines and the protocols. [-] And for having overwritten my repair protocols and tests the moment you stepped on board the TITAN? [-] So, how can I help you?[-] [-] I am just having a look at the warp core. [-] Impressive![-] [-] Yes. [-] Unbelievable what the techs have pulled out of that pile of junk in Antarctica four decades ago. [-] [-] [-]Nothing but destroyed devices and incomplete blueprints but now, somehow it just magically works. [-] You know what I mean.[-] [-] Yes, indeed.[-] [-] Just a question, if you don't mind? [-] What exactly are you doing here?[-] [-] As I said, having a look at the warp core and its optimizations.[-] [-] Hmm. [-] Ok. [-] Then enjoy your stay. [-] I am setting up the final routines. [-] Or do you want to rewrite them right away?[-] [-] No worries. [-] It seems there have been no issues with the schedule being moved forward, yes?[-] [-] Er, [-] ahem, [-] No. [-] Sure. [-] The teams have made exceptional progress since some office-sitter decided to throw them out of their beds. [-] This, after already working weeks with nearly no sleep.[-] [-] That's obviously the risk of working in the expedition fleet, right?[-] [-] Ha ha. [-] Tell you what, this whole 'expedition' thing is going a strange route. [-] Not to mention, there's a Council that governs all the decisions and the UCH is somehow in the dark. [-] Don't you think this requires some additional ... [-] explanation?[-] [-] No. What should we explain? [-] To whom? [-] There is nothing secret about the expedition, for those that are involved. [-] We'll tell the people what they need to know.[-] [-] Yes. That's exactly my point! As you might know, my grandpa was the lead engineer on the Hyperion. [-] He was not lost with the ship only for one simple reason: someone decided to reschedule his shift. [-] I'm thankful for that, but my grandpa never managed to get rid of the stigma of 'the coward that was left behind'.[-] [-] My dad moved to Mars with me after my grandpa's sudden death. [-] I signed up for the fleet right after college, to show what our family is capable of. [-] My dad said that Grandpa became crazy about this shit. [-] Pretending the officials just want to silence everyone. [-] Especially him personally, and the Hyperion Bereaved organization. [-] All his stories of a 'planned accident.' [-] The ship 'not being destroyed' and some 'threat' we are facing - all very dramatic.[-] [-] And, to be honest, until the last 24h, I always thought this old poor man simply could not cope with what happened. [-] When you showed up on board the Titan, I suddenly remembered one of my grandpa's stories, about some 'black suits' visiting the Hyperion a few days ahead of the mission.[-] [-] Commander. Please...[-] [-] I tell you what: [-] [-] I've been working for this project for nearly eight years now, and in these last few months, I've looked at this project and I've done the math. [-] In the last week, and in the last 24 h in particular, so many strange things have happened.[-] The GRAND and the TITAN each have several squads of marines on board. I checked the manifests yesterday. [-] We have stashed away tons and tons and tons of high caliber ammo. [-] I am an engineer. I know what these formulas and materials are made for. [-] This is not for asteroid defense. [-]  And now you are coming on board. [-] And the first thing you do, is to mess around with the protocols I have been developing for the last five years.[-] [-] The adjustments we've made are coming directly from Apollon labs. [-] Dr Greyson and Dr. Dawson?[-] [-] I know them. [-] But I have also looked at the changes you made. [-] These are risky. I am not sure what they should do exactly. [-] They don't seem to have any function that improves the efficiency of the warp drives.[-] [-] Rest assured, these have been approved by top specialists, everything is fine.[-] [-] Rest assured, if something goes wrong .. [-]and someone is harmed .. [-] and I discover that it was because of your changes .. [-] nothing will be fine .. [-] for you..
