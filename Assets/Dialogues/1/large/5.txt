No worries, Terran. [-] [-]Despite your questionable delay, I will be able to meet the schedule! [-] [-]There is a recreation area in the [-]office on the other side[-] of the building. [-] [-]So, thank you for your understanding, but please do not stand in my way any longer..
 Have something to offer? [-] Go to our traders. [-] [-]If not, you better get out of here, scumbag. [-].
 Hey scumbag, what do you want?.
[-]Buy a round[-].
[-]Ask for recipe[-].
Stumbling in a pirates base and first thing you do is buy a round! [-] Cheers man! [-]I assume we could do some business together?.
You don't look like a smuggler. [-] But hey .. might be your disguise, right? [-]What are you searching for? [-] The Sanashh clan has a lot to offer!.
Oh.. You are sure you are up to this?[-]Whatever. [-] Not my problem. [-]Head down to the bar. [-] Speak to Earl..
Artifacts? [-] Do I look like a damn archaeologist? [-]If you want to play with dry bones and broken glasses, check with those Polaris idiots and do not waste my time, man. [-] [-]Haha....
Hm.. [-] not sure what you are talking about..
Ho.. be careful, man. [-] [-]Appreciate you got to know from our latest coup, but better choose your next words wisely..
Ho! [-] Weapons down everyone! [-]Ok, here you are ...
[-]Don't follow me[-].
 You are dead meat, buddy!.
Ha! [-] Of course you are impressed! [-] We stole that recipe right in front of their eyes. [-] Walked in. [-] Showed our weapons. [-] And they ran away. [-] Hahaha. [-]Well, the only thing is: [-] What shall I do with that recipe now? [-]Pirates do not brew beer, but drink it - right, man?.
[-]Ask for client[-].
[-]Ask for recipe[-].
You are really new to this, right? [-]Client has booked us anonymously - but never picked up the recipe at the drop location. [-]We were paid, though. [-] Good deal. [-] Haha...
[-]Ask for recipe[-].
Yeah.. you know. [-] I really start to like your attitude. [-] [-]But there ain't no such thing as a free lunch, right?.
[-]Ask for price[-].
Hm.. [-] I think it is at least worth a platinum bar..
Alright! [-] [-]Head down to the loading area and speak to our paymaster Moebus. [-]He will finalize the deal..
Ah..! [-] [-]Finally someone who can make use of this. [-]Hope you can make profit from it, stranger..
Didn't the boss tell you to bring a platinum bar..? [-] [-]Get one and you'll get that recipe..
You seem to be new to all this, right? [-]If you do not want to get into trouble with the officials, maybe check with one of the bartenders of a [-]Sky Guys[-] or [-]Pax Purgatory[-] bar. [-] [-]You could also mine the platinum ore or buy ingots from a mining corp and refine yourself. [-]Now get lost..
This is Brewmaster Lark speaking! [-] Battlestations! [-] [-]We have been sabotaged! [-] Sabotaged I tell you! [-]Defenses and Turrets are shut down and we are tracking enemy signals coming from all sides! [-] To everyone with a weapon: [-] Defend the station until we are back online! [-] Protect the recipe at all costs!.
[-]Lock and Load[-].
Formidable! [-] How can we ever repay you for this extraordinary service?.
[-]Promised Root Beer?[-].
Ah - I know! [-] A ticket for the anniversary party! [-] [-]It was sold out months ago!.
Please head to the [-]INFERNO CLUB[-]. [-] Check with the [-]CLUB MANAGER Slick[-]! [-] [-]The root beer delivery has already been dispatched with a shuttle. [-] So nothing remains for you to do. [-] You will get the promised gratification of course! [-] [-]Thanks again for helping in our ongoing product evaluation program!.
[-]Has been a pleasure.[-].
Wonderful! [-] Have a great time!.
The Inferno Club welcomes all desires! [-] I am Club Manager Slick. [-]I have been messaged by Brewmaster Yilk about your engagement in our most recent release! [-]Please make yourself comfortable. [-] Your suit will be upgraded to VIP status and you have already been added to our lifetime VIP list! [-] Please check with the bartender downstairs for a taste of our BEST SELLING Totally Overpowered Root Beer! [-] May I ask if your venerable crew will attend as well?.

Hey! [-] Like I told the last squid head, no cred... [-] [-]Ah! [-] VIP status! [-] Ok... [-]Ahhhh! [-] This you! [-] Please excuse my harsh words, but we've had some trouble lately. [-] Sooo.. [-] here you are! [-] One Anniversary BEST SELLING root beer! [-] Made possible, thanks to your efforts - as I heard from my colleague in the distillery!.
[-]Usual days work[-].
Sounds like these are everyday missions for your crew!.
Oh sorry... I just noticed the insignia on your collar. [-] Been a while though..
Let me think. [-] It happened a few months ago. [-] A few strangers with uniforms like yours came to the club and ran into some of those always drunken Zirax troopers. [-] [-]Zirax Empire. [-] Bah. [-] Scourge of Andromeda. [-] Always trying to blackmail the people here. [-] Then your people came in, asking for something, noticed the Zirax and then things.. [-] got crazy. [-] HaaHaa.. [-] They have beaten those Zirax out of the club. [-] Literally. [-] We had to redecorate the main hall .. [-] but hey.. what a show! [-] Now we have our own security personnel here. [-] Bad for some.. [-] customers. [-] But hey...
[-]Anything else maybe?[-].
Hm. [-] Not much, I am afraid. [-] [-]One of yours was called.. [-] hmmmmm.. [-] was something with Al.. [-] Alf.. [-] Axl? [-] Not sure to be honest..
Yes! That was the name! [-] [-]Wait! [-] They talked about a remote planet and a ship waiting somewhere for someone. [-] [-]Ah ... [-] before I forget about it: One of them left behind a specially modified drill. I have it at my desk. [-] I have no use for it, so you should have it, or return it to its owner..
 Great to hear! [-] Relay my greetings when you meet them. [-] [-]Enjoy your root beer, my friend..
 Welcome, my dear friend!.
[-]Zirax? UCH survivors? Alex?[-].
[-]And that means?[-].
[-]Interesting but also risky?[-].
 Nothing to worry about. [-] Just a little surveillance task. [-]Take care, my friend!.
Welcome! [-] I hope you had a good flight! [-] Those Zirax patrols are annoying. [-] Hope you didn't have any trouble with them?.
[-]No more than usual[-].
[-]I am always underway in some way.[-].
[-]Working with professionals[-].
 Er, thanks! [-] Hehe ... [-] ahem ... [-] I mean ....
Yes. Yes, of course! [-] So the foreman of yesterday's shift reported that something strange had been found right when they broke the first rocks of this new promethium vein. [-] [-]He said it was some kind of a stick, wrapped in cloth and made from a never-before-seen material. [-] I first thought they were having a joke at my expense ... [-] as usual ... [-] but the first analysis indicated the item they found is extremely old and it seems to contain a power source. [-] So, in order to prevent disturbing something, I stopped all work on that mine and informed headquarters, following the new guidelines for reporting archeological discoveries. [-] All of the crew, except the managers have been sent home for the time being..
[-]May I speak to the shift manager?[-].
Of course! [-] I am currently busy with writing this report anyway. [-] It should be ready when you leave. [-] [-]Meanwhile, the station is at your disposal..
Welcome, Inspector! [-] GLaD you are here!.
[-]Join in the charade[-].
Inspector, of course you weren't sent here to listen to an old digger, right? [-] If I were you, [-] I would take the opportunity to [-] go to our [-]CELLAR [-] and fetch some rare wine, but leave before the [-]RATS [-]come after you. [-]Let me know when you are ready, so we can cheer with a [-]SMILEY FACE[-], when you are back..
[-]Leave for the cellar[-].
Welcome, Keeper of the Staff of Guidance! [-]How can I serve you?.
 Of course, most noble ambassador of a distant galaxy..
[-]Purpose of Station?[-].
This is what remains of Mahan Station, of the glorious Zirax-Talon Assembly! [-] Centuries passed, since this fragment of a once mesmerizing world was caught by the gravity of that yellow star. [-] [-]This part of the archive has survived the test of time, the war of silence, and the destruction of its home world, preserving the history and technology of the glorious past, for you or anyone else to make good use of it..
975 years, High Representative. [-] It has been a long wait. [-] [-]The others, [-] those that tried to rob all the data, [-] destroyed much of the information that was preserved in this place [-] before they fell victim to the infestations. [-] This infection will not be destroyed by any passing of time. [-]No explosion or weapon found in the past could stop it either. [-] [-]But now you are here!.
I am afraid many parts of my data nodes are destroyed. [-] [-]And, [-] possibly due to the removal of the contamination shields, [-] the degradation of information continues. [-]This place is doomed. [-] As a last service, [-] my humble self has managed to reactivate some of the data displays behind me. [-] [-]Take whatever you get and make the best of it! [-] [-]Bi'huan, noble Keeper of the Staff or Guidance!.
Hello, my dear friend! [-] [-]Seems you were even more lucky with your mission than we ever expected! [-] [-]IDA has already sent over the schematics of those two ancient Talon energy weapons. [-] After a quick analysis, we are confident we will finally be able to mass-produce them! [-] Of course, all in the utmost secrecy. [-] As you may have learned, the Talon are not the ignorant natives under Zirax control everyone thinks they are. [-]There have been many unsuccessful attempts to change that situation. [-]Now, we have a real chance, [-] thanks to your efforts! [-]This will definitely shake up this sector, [-] and then ... [-] the Galaxy! [-] Please, take these technical components as compensation for the dangers you faced on our behalf. [-] [-]We think you can probably make good use of them. [-] [-]Now, please excuse me. [-] We will speak again soon!.
