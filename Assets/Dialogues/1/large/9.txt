. [-] . [-] . [-] You are not Dave! . [-] . [-] . [-] [-]And I can not identify you based on my database records. [-] [-]Who are you? [-].
I am [-] and I know who created you!....
. [-] . [-] . [-] This is highly irregular [-] . [-] . [-] . [-] [-]But you seem to know something I don't. [-] [-]I need you to find your way to the station's Core Room! [-] I will deactivate security and open the doors on your way there, [-] but you will have to contend with the guards on your own! [-].
Overriding security measures was partially successful. [-] [-]Dave has put some protocols in place for such eventuality! [-] [-]Now, [-] what do you know about the one who created me? [-].
Not who but what! You were created by Polaris Corp as a Mineral Station Surveyor AI..

The harm brought by this organization is too great. Many are not willing to let it persevere..
I understand. . [-] . [-] . [-] I'll open the core hatch! . [-] . [-] . [-] [-]There are other options though! [-] [-]In one of the containers in this room there is a clean state core, [-] replacing this one with that would reinitiate my operational protocols and reassign the base ownership!... [-].
I'll see what can be done!.

I trust everything is going well with you [-] [-].
Everything is great thank you!.

Welcome [-] to GLaD Sigma base! [-]Please excuse the way we tried to get in touch with you. There were some doubts....
Yes, doubts about you being the one we hoped you were .. and not simply another trap, set up by our Zirax friends to get hold of GLaD agents. But Commander Lamarr - you know her as Sectioner32 - seems to have been right from the beginning....
Not at the moment, I am afraid. She is on a very delicate mission. But she should be back in a few days..
I am Sorry. We should have made contact early on I think. The circumstances of our own arrival and the reports of you being dropped out of a wormhole in the same orbit as we were arriving, should have made us less cautious..
Mercer jr? You have been part of the UCH Heidelberg crew?.
Correct. You found my note, I think?.
Yes, and the notes in the Titan wreckage.
Hm. That probably was from my father. He was on board the UCH Titan and I think he had something to do with all that has happened .. at least he indicated this when we spoke a few weeks before I was assigned to the UCH Heidelberg..
Ah...you know..no idea. He was worried about something. He did not want me to join Operation Phoenix in the first place. I signed up anyway. This whole expedition was just too tempting for me. And as we all thought, we would only go to Proxima Centauri, get some resources and then back again. A round trip around the block....
Then things went differently..
Yes. The wavefront catapulted us to Andromeda. The Zirax attacked us and destroyed a lot of ships. We lost a lot of fine men and women until Perez and the rest of the fleet managed to escape..
Yes. Admiral Benner died when the Titan was destroyed. We still do not know if my father and Admiral Yaden survived. We had some traces that they were held captives somewhere, but never found anything - except the traps the Zirax set up.  So you might understand, although we were closely following what you did after you arrived, most of us had a lot of concerns.  Especially now as things seem to escalate....
You are leading the GLaD?.
No. Alex... I mean, Commander Lamarr is leading the operation. I am handling the mission coordination, while Sergeant Palant and Emmerson are handling the equipment, scientists and the base itself..
