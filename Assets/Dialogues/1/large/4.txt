Commander. [-] There is no sign of the warriors. [-]On the positive side: While we are here, you should have a closer look at these inscription plates..
[-]Maybe there is a hidden basement?[-].
[-]Legacy? Infinite ... what?[-].
[-]Out of here. QUICK![-].
[-]Tell about the infected warrior[-].
[-]The inscriptions were damaged.[-].

[-]Same to you![-].
Commander! [-] We are receiving a priority message from agent Kezzel!.
Hello my friend! [-] I am happy to see you still alive ... [-] This is kind of an urgent call. [-] We have received some alarming info [-] ..about the Legacy! [-] Seems there is more behind it as we hoped.  [-] Long story short: [-] We heard from Polaris officials that they've lost one of their capital vessels - [-] the Ilmarinen.[-] The vessel was exploring distant systems for the last few years. [-] It's goal was to find new worlds and new resources. [-] The company lost contact with the ship about half a year ago. [-]They have found its trace, [-] but because of the Zirax patrols getting much more frequent in the months since your people's arrival, [-] they are not able to officially investigate themselves. [-] Now they are asking if we could lend them a hand..
[-]And with 'we' you actually mean me.. correct?[-].

Ilmarinen Exploration Crew, [-] 2nd Commander Fract'alite. [-] THIS IS a WARNING to the pilot approaching this station! [-] Hold your distance, pick up this message and relay it to the Polaris HQ! [-] The Ilmarinen is heading for this planet, but it is not under our control! [-] To anyone who is reading this: [-] Code Omega! [-] DESTROY that whole ship! [-] We picked something up, which killed the entire crew and took control of the ship. [-] We managed to survive long enough to find this station and send this recorded warning, [-] but no doubt we are already dead. [-] Do not search for survivors. [-] I repeat: [-] DESTROY that ship and this station as well with the strongest weapons you have! [-] Do NOT leave even dust! [-] I am so sorry. [-] Chief SaintJohn was absolutely right from the beginning. [-] [-]We might have revived the dark times. [-] May the galaxy forgive us ...
 Authorization Code.. [-] [-] .. accepted. [-]Listing available logs .. [-] [-] .. Log found: SAINTJOHN, Chief Engineer [-] [-]Play?.
Mission day 500. [-] [-]Log entry 197 [-] [-]We have found something! [-] 500 days searching for habitable worlds. 500 days without any success. [-] We found a lot of resources, sure. But the captain said, we cannot deviate from our mission. [-] The mining crews will take it easy while we head to the next star. [-] At least we have found something interesting today. A burnt-out world near a red dwarf. [-] The captain has allowed me to join the expedition! [-] This will feel like a holiday after 499 days staring at the sensor logs and cataloging broken doors. [-] I am quite excited!.
Mission day 501. [-] [-]Log entry 202 [-] [-]Official Complaint [-] I am adding this to the ship's log, so no one will complain if Hangar B needs to be overhauled. [-] These science guys could not leave this, this ... [-] thing ... [-] on the planet! [-] Since we need to hurry to the next damn star, they simply brought it aboard the ship! [-] There is enough room, the captain said. [-] Sure. [-] But I'm the one that'll need to explain the damages, scratches and strange melted traces in the hangar. [-] If it was me, we'd have left it where it was. [-] [-]Damn science kids..
Mission day 503. [-] [-]Log entry 280 [-]Message to the Captain [-] This mess happening in Hangar B is getting out of control, Frank! [-] The wreckage has lost ... [-] weight ... [-] and even mass, which seems crazy. [-] Spilling some substance all over the floor. [-] We have sealed the doors, but I doubt this will keep this slippery stuff inside. [-] As our lead scientist told me, the wreckage they picked up was covered in a biological substance, which seems to moulder due to the changed atmospheric parameters. [-] Really great. [-] Can you guys guess who's getting assigned to the cleaning squad?.
Mission day 514. [-] [-]Log entry 382 [-]Personal Note 32 [-] What did they bring on board? [-] These idiots! [-] This wasn't some sort of biological remamins, melting from the ship. [-] No, the ship ITSELF is transforming into a semi-liquid state! [-] And if that wasn't enough, the substance is growing on every surface like a ... [-] mushroom. [-] Sending out spores that [-] - hopefully - [-] now are being removed from the airducts again. [-] We might possibly have to cut off this entire section from the ship to prevent this getting out of hand!.
Mission day 520. [-] [-]Log entry 420 [-]Official ship log entry, interim captain of the Ilmarinen, C. SaintJohn. [-] The captain and the 2nd Commander have been sent to the medbay. [-] As well as a third of the crew. [-] The spores have led to some serious infections. [-] We've sent a message to the HQ that all ships are not to make contact with any of these wreckages, which we now refer to as 'Infectors'. [-] This seems to be what they do. [-] The report and a warning was sent a day ago. [-] Until help arrives it might take a while. [-] I am afraid we have to seal large parts of the ship and flood the areas with decontamination fluids..
Mission day 550. [-] [-]Log entry 480 [-]Who cares.. [-] The crew is lost. [-] Or transformed. [-] Or what would you call it? [-] We've lost main control of the ship. [-] My crew and I at least managed to prevent the alien organisms taking full control, but we could not prevent the ship from moving back to Ellyon. [-] For whatever reason it wants to go there. [-] We have damaged the engines, but I am afraid this ... [-] substance ... [-] is able to repair them over time. [-] We did not manage to activate the self-destruct. [-] So I am putting this as a warning for anyone reading this. [-] Get out of here as quick as you can and blast this ship into pieces. [-] It is on you to stop this plaque from spreading to inhabited worlds!.
.. [-] THERE..! [-] LEGACY .. [-] PLEASE HEL..! [-] [-].
Commander? [-] [-]Shall I send the report of our investigations to agent Kezzel right away?.
Please do so asap!.
Commander! I am glad you survived this. [-] But we are afraid, things are even worse than we feared. [-] The Talon have warned us. [-] It seems The Legacy has risen again in a distant place. [-] And the poor people of the Ilmarinen have accidentally brought it back to this system. [-] We will forward your report and contact our allies and talk about the next steps. [-] Hopefully we found this ship early enough to avoid a second War of Silence. [-] I'll report back asap..
