Ha, [-] I knew you would be volunteering to find out what is going on! [-] The Polaris HQ has sent us the coordinates of a small vessel they had contact with. [-] The Ilmarinen crew is said to have had contact with a control station, from where they messaged the pilot of this vessel ... [-] but the transmission was suddenly lost and the pilot failed to arrive at the HQ.  [-] [-]The [-]control station[-] can be found in the [-]orbit of the BARREN planet[-] in this system. [-] Proceed with great caution. [-] This might be the first time we might run into this menace after hundreds of years it was said to have .. [-] vanished..
First, we would like to send you on a simple mission: [-] Go to the [-]Asteroid Field[-] at the edge of the Ellyon system. [-] There you will find a [-]Polaris Mining Facility[-]. [-] Approach it and wait for further orders. [-]Your suit AI has just been sent the mission package. [-] [-]It will be decrypted step by step and reveal all necessary info when you arrive there..
You seem to be surprised to speak to a hovering smiley face in front of a terminal? [-]I am afraid we need to have some ... [-] security measures in place. [-] [-]That's why I'm speaking to you via this remote access terminal..
... [-] I currently can't relay any of that information, I am afraid. [-] ... [-]But let's get started. [-] [-]The Zirax Scum are always on our heels and the AI protecting our little meeting is already detecting some cyber-espionage patterns trying to break in on our conversation..
First and foremost, I am .. [-] your contact person, Sectioner32. [-] [-]On behalf of GLaD, the [-]G[-]alactic [-]L[-]iberation [-]a[-]nd [-]D[-]efense organization, I would like to thank you for answering our call. [-]You won't regret it. [-] And it will make the galaxy a better place!.
Ah, good. [-] Well .. [-] [-]Headquarters said they would send an inspector sometime soon. [-] [-]But .. [-] hm .. you must have been already underway, right?.
Of course ... [-] Ah ... [-] Sorry ... [-] [-]Please excuse me, I'm a bit nervous. [-] We are ALL a bit anxious over here, since we found that ... [-] item ... [-] down there. [-] [-]Of course, we didn't tell anyone outside this facility..
First let me note, the mining operations on the [-]PLANET[-] have gone very well. [-] I often feel like a [-]REMNANT [-] when I look at all those great people working on this project. [-] You would be surprised, we often do not need to descend into the dark [-]MINE [-] to find interesting opportunities. [-] If you ask me, each house needs some [-]GUIDANCE[-], [-] even if you need to handle it on a staff or on a [-]STICK[-], [-] before venturing to places where [-]ANCIENT HISTORY[-] is still breathing..
Commander, [-] our new Talon friends have just sent us the position of a large crashed vessel. [-]They suspect it is one of ours, as some of the survivors came from its direction, they say. [-] There is one caveat, though. [-] We need to take into account what the Talon Chief said.[-] The survivors came to this settlement a planetary rotation ago. [-] This might indicate that the console we found that message was not broken .. [-] but we have lost one year while being dragged to Andromeda ....
Let's go there and find out..
The ancient be praised! [-] You are coming to rescue me from this Zirax scum [-] .. I hope?.
Just kidding. How did you end up here imprisoned?   [-](Story)[-].
Interesting story! [-] I was sent to this planet to investigate the recent activities of the gravitational anomaly that seems to spit out ships and crews into this system from time to time. [-] Risky mission, due to the Zirax presence.. [-] but as the last reported event was exactly one year ago, I was sent to see what is going on again. [-] I only made the mistake to set up my camp right here for investigating the resonance waves in materials that went through that anomaly already once and... [-] I digress....
What do you know about the incident a year ago?.
Not much, I am afraid. [-] We got a report of a gravitational anomaly in this sector. [-] The Zirax Empire was amassing ships at its exit. [-] I think they were not as surprised as we were. [-] Some of the ships of the incoming fleet managed to escape. [-] Some were destroyed and some crashed on the planets of this system. [-] Like the one nearby. [-] The survivors managed to escape the Zirax, thanks to the help of the Talon and my people. [-] They mentioned something about an expedition fleet .. [-] Operation Phoenix. I think..
Do you know where the survivors went?.
Yes and no. [-] After our rescue teams managed to bring them past the Zirax lines and off that planet, they were picked up by one of their vessels. [-] I am afraid I have no info where they went. [-] BUT when you want to find them, I suggest you find agent Kezzel. [-] He will probably be around in the Sanctuary as he is my contact for this mission. [-]That being said .. [-]  I know you just risked your life saving me from the Zirax. [-] But may I ask you for a favor nevertheless?.
I am pretty sure the Zirax will send reinforcements soon. [-] And as they know my face and, [-] as you might have guessed, [-] I do not have any combat experience .. [-] I will be arrested in no time. [-] May I ask you then to bring this encrypted data chip to agent Kezzel? [-] It holds a [-]Space Anomalies Report[-] with info about the anomaly and how it affects certain materials. [-] They are extremely valuable. [-] Tell him Dr. Mandor sent you. [-] I will message him that you are underway. [-] He might be willing to give you more info about Operation Phoenix..
Sure. I need to go there anyway..
Thanks a lot, my friend! [-] [-]Feel free to take my [-]Hover Vessel[-] I parked nearby. [-] The troopers have removed some devices .. [-] to sell them .. [-] but they are still over there in the containers. [-] Simply put them back and you are good to go..
Thanks, but how will you get away then?.
The extraction team will arrive anytime soon, but I won't be able to go to the Sanctuary. [-] The security protocol requires we need to quietly leave the planet as quickly as possible .. [-]  before more Zirax arrive to find out why their troops do not report back anymore. [-]So, no worries, my friend. [-] Wish you all the best!.

..has hit us hard. [-] Kind of a large projectile or a very advanced rocket. [-] We got separated from the main fleet. [-] These guys have cut us off from the rest and are trying to bring us down. [-] They will be successful. [-] The captain has sent the emergency rescue signal. [-] We are making an emergency landing. [-] All engines are off. [-] I am off to the rescue pod. [-]Nicole Palant, [-]Chief Engineer 1st class, UCH Heidelberg[-].
Captain Brenner and most of the flight team were killed just seconds ago. [-] A projectile hit the bow amidships. [-] I was incredibly lucky. [-] My absolutely justified criticisms, made after we ran into this mess, [-] caused the lieutenant to send me to check the lifeboats - [-] seconds before the bridge was hit. [-] Karma ? Maybe not. [-] Now, I can't leave this room. [-] The doors are sealed. [-] I'm standing in front of the lifeboat section and cannot enter it, which doesn't matter anyway, as the whole section is missing and I am staring into the sky through a big hole in the hull. [-] The ground is coming closer. [-] I just heard the tearing of metal. The ship is breaking apart. [-]  Hope at least our engineers did their job when building that section. [-]John Emmerson, Ensign UCH Heidelberg[-].
Hm.. so, this is the Heidelberg. IDA?.
Obviously, Commander. [-] [-]While you went through the ship, I took the time and analyzed the weathering of the material..
I know what you want to say...
Yes, Commander. [-] We lost a full year in the gravitational anomaly. [-] If there once were survivors, they have moved on. [-] And everything we have heard about the Zirax and the situation on this planet.. [-] it is more than unlikely that we will find them in this system. [-] That all explains why I could not make contact with the fleet. [-] [-]We need to face the facts .. [-] and move on..
We need to get off that damn planet first..
Correct. [-] [-]Pick up the Hover Vessel nearby and find the Sanctuary. [-] Speak to agent Kezzel. [-] [-]In case our new friend Dr. Mandor can be trusted, he might be willing to help someone from the 'terran expedition forces' [-] .. in return for a favor .. [-] possibly..
Ha. For sure. But the only way to go..
What do you want? [-] Quick..
Speaking to the commander of the station..
Haha. [-] Sure. [-] You and the rest of the f... planet. [-] Who do you think you are? [-] Don't waste my time..
Eh... Dr. Mandor sends me..
So.. the Doctor has sent you. [-] Wonderful! [-]Then I'll better contact the committee and announce your arrival with trumpets and fanfares...! [-].. [-] [-]Do I look like an idiot? [-] Get out of my sight or I'll.. [-] .. [-] ..[-] oh.. I am getting a call. [-] Who will that be? [-] Possibly someone with nice advice to throw you out of the station or arrest you right away?.
Better answer that call..
Hmpf. [-] Seems like you said the truth. [-]  My pardon. [-] Things are becoming a bit .. [-] rough .. the last days and there are too few of us to protect the Sanctuary. [-] Anyways.. [-]You see that [-]elevator[-] behind me? [-] [-]Go up one level. [-] Then to the right. [-] [-]Hurry up. [-] Carver is waiting for you..
Hello Sir! [-] [-]I heard the Doctor was sending you over? [-] [-]May I ask what is the reason for him not being available personally?.
He wanted me to fetch some of his equipment..
