Commander Zerogen, Lt. Senner [-] Ensign Yasir, Ensign Adams [-] [-] Yasir! [-] Any news from Apollon station? [-] [-] Sir, Apollon Station has vanished from our screens a few seconds ago! [-] [-] I'm afraid the scans indicate a giant explosion. [-] [-] Emergency protocol! [-] Immediately send rescue units. [-] [-] I am afraid we cannot send any craft. [-] All vessels are currently in their final docking positions. [-] Undocking would require more than an hour. [-] [-] Sir! [-] A transport is approaching us. [-] Survivors of Apollon Station! [-] [-] Lamarr.. [-] ehm .. [-] check the transport for any anomalies. [-] Docking procedure, please. [-] [-] Captain! [-] There is something going on with the TITAN! [-] And the GRAND! [-] The warp drives are coming online! [-] The warp protocol has been started and .. [-] [-] Mercer! [-] Stop this! [-] That is not going to happen! [-] [-] I am afraid Sir, this cannot be stopped.

[-]It's about time![-].
Hello Commander! [-] You managed to reactivate my systems! [-] And I might owe you some explanations. [-].. [-]I am afraid there is a little information that relates to our [-] .. [-] issues on Apollon station and [-] .. [-] our voyage [-] .. [-] that I was not able to reveal to you..
I am afraid I am still partially blocked from some important files by the remains of the Waverider Protocol. [-] [-]But thanks to you, retrieving the code sequence for CODE BLACK, I am now able to remove the digital seals. [-]What I can say, after having analyzed just the raw data I can now access .. [-] this whole transport to Andromeda did not happen by accident..
[-]That would be quite disturbing.[-].
You are right. [-] It should be impossible to have foreseen the complex sequence of events up to this point. [-] I have no answer for that, Commander. [-] However, with the new data, I have further analyzed our current situation..
[-]Please summarize the mess[-].
This whole operation seems to have had totally different goals than the ones the teams were told. [-] The official story was, we would be going on a short trip to Proxima Centauri to get more Pentaxid to help Earth survive. [-] The fleet left the Jupiter orbit - forced by the Waverider Protocol as it seems - and ended up billions of light years beyond that point! [-] In Andromeda! [-] The irregular Vortex we were dragged into might have been the reason for the passage to Andromeda. [-] A wavefront, which pushed us further than the warp drives could ever have achieved alone. [-] It seems like this was finely planned up to the very second. [-] Although I'm not sure if our little one-year delay was planned as well or just an accident either. [-] Anyways. [-] As far as we know, the fleet was attacked immediately upon arrival here .. [-] which makes me think, those Zirax were waiting for them. [-] Or they simply ended up in a galactic hornet's nest,  where everyone is pretty nervous. [-] Shoot first, ask later. [-] [-]Similar things might have happened before. [-] Not sure if the council knew about that .. [-] but they armed the fleet as much as possible..
[-]A risk that probably did not pay out?[-].
Probably. [-] I found the last available bridge protocol. [-] [-]It is partially destroyed, though: [-] July 26, 2473[-] Admiral Benner [-] Commander Mercer [-] [-] Sir! We can't wait any longer. [-] The unknown enemy is amassing more and more ships. [-] We've already lost two transports and the TITAN will not stand a chance. [-] Please, get to the shuttle! [-] [-] Mercer, this is not your command. [-] Get out of here [-] and take Yaden with you. [-] We still must investigate the anomaly we found when entering this system. [-] I will report to Admiral Perez on the GRAND. [-] [-] How shall we..? [-] [-] [-] [-] [-] [-] This is Admiral Benner! [-] All personnel, abandon ship! [-] I repeat. [-] ABANDON SHIP! [-] The TITAN is lost! [-] All personnel go to the rescue pods! [-] [-] The GRAND and the rest of the fleet will warp out any minute. I rep... [-] [-] THEIA! [-] Make contact to .. [-] ..  the GRAND. [-] [-] [-]Our transceiver is damaged. We can send only, Vice Admiral. [-] [-] Contact established! [-] [-] Perez.. listen .. [-] I don't have a lot of time left. [-] We are pulling the enemies away from you! [-] .. we have de..cted the an...old relict! [-] A planetary remnant! [-] The wavefront .. originates from there! [-] We need to .. stay away from .. [-] [-]..end of message..[-].
[-]At least something[-].
 At least we know, most of the fleet survived and retreated to an undisclosed location..
[-]Dead end for now?[-].
Not necessarily! [-] Although that hidden subroutine knocked me out, the suit subsystems still gathered information. [-] It seems like the long range antenna array of this wreckage is still working! [-] If I can power them for just a few minutes, we could send an emergency broadcast. [-] But this would mean the Zirax would send everything they have at this position. Given the military sites nearby, this will leave you with only a few moments to get prepared for them. [-] [-]Better fight them with your vessel[-], than on foot. [-] Either way. You need to keep the troops busy for a few minutes, until the antenna completes sending the signal..
[-]Lock and Load[-].
[-]They do not seem to be surprised ...[-].
We have met others of your terran tribe a while ago. [-]And yes... [-] Our settlement might look primitive to you, but we are not primitives. [-]We have intentionally chosen this life!.
No worries, stranger. Mehakka! [-] If you were falsely led to believe that we are just a primitive tribe, then this is proof we have succeeded. We've spent an era cultivating this falsehood. Our ongoing efforts to hide our knowledge and talents from .. [-] .. others .. [-] is how we would have it..
[-]What's this about other terrans?[-].
I know how to survive.
 Hmm ... that's interesting, what you say. [-] [-]This hasn't been reported since ...[-] ... [-] There is .. [-] or maybe ... [-] hmm. [-] [-]I wonder if it is you that ... ? [-] ... [-] The following might sound strange to you, but may I ask you to buy ONE Sprout from our trader and then come back to me?.
[-]Er .. ah .. Sure.[-].
