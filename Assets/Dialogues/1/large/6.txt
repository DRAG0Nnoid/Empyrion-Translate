[-] [-] Commander? [-] I must say that I'm not entirely sure we've done a good deed by helping these GLaD guys. [-]Calculations indicate that this will certainly set something off. [-] [-]Possibly we have just lit the fuse of the galactic powder keg [-] thanks to our involvement here..
[-] [-] We should try to learn more and get  prepared for what is surely about to come..
[-]Let's get going.[-].
How may I serve you?.
What is the latest news?.
Please show me your offers..
Special offers are always to be expected!.
Hey we talked already [-] times, that's enough for now!.
Let's start from the beginning.
Yes, I give it to you as a present.
No, I want to keep it.
I need to go.
Can you give me some food?.
I need to go..
I never dreamt that I would get the statue back! I will give you rich presents for that..
Yes of course. Here is some sea grass. Can I help you more?.
You already got food but here is some more seagrass. Now choose something else!.
You will not get any more food! Bye!.
The story of the Talon began a long, long time ago....
Integrated Data Assistant (IDA).
Welcome to the UCH A01 Gamma training site![-]Please confirm to start the Robinson Protocol qualification program..
Ensign [-]! [-]You have been dropped to A01 Gamma to complete your basic survival training. [-] [-]Note this is not a drill or a simulation anymore! [-] But no worries. [-]Follow the instructions of your Integrated Data Assistant ([-]IDA[-]), and you will succeed! [-]Let's get started! [-]Captain Hyde, [-] out..
So, you guys again. [-]Has only been a year, when we solved the same issue for the UCH already. [-]You are doing this 'help me to escape from that planet' as an anniversary event, right?[-].
Just kidding. [-]Of course we are glad we could help your people to escape from the Zirax scumbags back then. [-]Has been a lot of fun to fool them around.[-]Now, let's get started. [-] I have the teleporter, but your commander has agreed to help us with a little .. problem..
Nothing too complicated. Please speak to Kanydan. You might have seen him when you came here. He is fiercely discussing some strange Talon topic with one of the Traders.[-] Hell, you can even hear him up here![-] Something about a technical artifact.[-] Did not even know they do care about that kind of stuff. [-] Anyways. Speak to him. Do whatever he wants and come back to me.[-]I'll have some drinks on your bill in the meantime..
..this is ABSOLUTELY unacceptable. [-]This is profiteering! [-]This is...[-].
Ah! Good you are here! [-]Can you please tell this .. formidable person of a .. that every sane warrior will never defile the tombs of an elder, just for fetching some forgotten things? [-]This is insane..!.
[-]What is actually the problem?[-].
The problem?   These .. alleged archeologists .. have not only defiled a holy place, but they also ran away like cowards, leaving behind the only thing worth the hassle, as soon as some minor problems turned up. [-] Now they are refusing to bring back what I sent them to look for, although they were paid! Pretending I would have had to tell them about the dangers. [-]A century old technical artifact. Incredibly important for us. And they ran away .. do you believe that?.
[-]So you paid them to defile a holy place without telling them the whole story?[-].
Well .. I might .. maybe .. but .. [-]THAT is not what this is all about! [-]I need to get that technical artifact. I was told some warrior from the Terrans will come and help. [-]My people helped your people over in the Ellyon System, when they had to flee from the Zirax![-]Hm.. strange coincidence.. this was exactly a year ago...[-] .. Anyways.. [-]Will you help me or are you a coward as well?.
[-]I will help[-].
Great. [-]Your task is simple: go down to the catacombs of the Elders Tomb and find the Technical Artifact left behind in one of the cargo boxes.[-]Ehm .. and make sure you are well prepared. [-] It might be dangerous down there..
Ah .. you are back!  [-]Did you find what I am looking for?.
[-]Give Artifact to Kanydan[-].
You did not find the Technical Artifact yet?  [-]Please come back when you have it!.
Wonderful![-]Your service is worth an honorable mention in our tribe's history..
[-]I am honored.[-].
Wait a second. [-]I just received alarming news from my brothers just before the communication was blocked. The anomaly in the Ellyon system, the one that led to the arrival of your fleet,  has been seen again. We are not sure what this means, but this does not sound good.  [-] Better get that info back to your leaders..
I've heard you performed well. Kanydan has asked me to sign an honorable mention about your services. Seems like you have impressed him. Not something achieved easily. Congratulations! [-]Here, got you a Teleporter and an additional EVA Boost module for your suit. You might need it when you go to space.[-]But there is something important for your commanders to know:[-]Our ships over at the Ellyon system have sent a report about a single pilot that was spit out of the same anomaly that brought your fleet to this galaxy. We are currently trying to make contact with our local forces, so he or she does not run into the same trap as your fleet.  I cannot send this com to your station as long as there are Zirax troops around and communication is blocked, but in case you speak to your commanders, please advise them to make the GLaD guys aware of the situation. I assume we do not have a lot of time. Things are coming in motion. I can feel it....
Please specify your question..
Where can I find a Cobalt deposit?.
Bookmark added to your REGISTRY! [-]Access your status info (TAB) and select the REGISTRY icon in the top row to see all of your bookmarks.[-]Any bookmark and position you discover will be listed there. Use the 'waypoint' function to set markers you can then follow on your HUD.
Ah, Ensign [-]! Welcome to the Severance. [-]Glad to see you up here - and face to face for the first time! Your test results have been exceptional and you have achieved far more than any other cadet before! [-] I hoped we would have more time for a real debriefing, but we need to get out of that system immediately! While we speak, the last shuttles have docked to the Severance and the Zirax fleet is arriving any minute. [-]Get up to the bridge and take the chair in the middle[-] [-].. Lieutenant, junior grade, [-]!.
Congratulations on your promotion, Lieutenant, junior grade!.
No time for chatter!  We need to get out of here. [-]Have a seat in the Captain's Chair and use the Station Services to [-]refill ammo, fuel and pentaxid. [-]Without pentaxid, we cannot warp.[-]Then [-]fly us away from the station.[-].
