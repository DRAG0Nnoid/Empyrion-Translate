[-] [-] The Waverider protocol has been activated! [-] [-] Great! [-] The wait is over! [-] Now let's prepare DAVE and the equipment for the final stage of the project. [-] Did you save the latest data from the listening posts? [-] [-] Of course, Ma'am. [-] DAVE is already processing the parameters and adjustments. [-] [-] Good. [-] This will be a giant leap for mankind. [-] DAVE? [-] [-] I am already starting the routines, Doctor. [-] [-] Time left? [-] [-] The event will take place in 22h and 25 minutes at about 16:00 local time. [-] [-].
Interesting... this must be something DAVE added to my log..

[-] [-] [-] [-] [-] [-] You've got a new message. [-] Shall I play it? [-] [-] [-] ..f course..! [-] [-] Hey honey! [-] Awake yet? :D [-] I tried to not wake you up, but they've already sent me over to the TITAN for the final checks. [-] Big day today, right? [-] We'll do the anniversary party over here. [-] Comm Chief de Vries will come over from the GRAND and attend as well! [-] Captain Benner told me you'll have to do something for the Lab-A guys and your shuttle is scheduled for 16:00. [-] So while you're there, remind Greyson and Dawson they will have to bring the single malt. [-] We won that last round, yesterday! :D [-] Don't be late and don't forget the cake!

[-] [-] Commander [-], hope you did not forget Captain Benner kindly allowed me to requisition you for a final assignment, before you leave for the TITAN. [-] Please check with the quarter master for your upgraded suit and equipment. [-] Then please come down to Lab A. [-] Oh, and Happy Anniversary to you and Alex! [-] - Greyson [-] [-] Servo! [-] Can you please check the message folder? [-] I am quite sure there were no new assignments when I was checking the inbox before we went to bed! [-] [-] I am afraid, I can not give an answer. [-] No logs are available for the specified time. [-] [-] Hmm... [-] interesting. [-] Seems that everyone is getting crazy, the closer we get to the departure date. [-] Even the station AIs. [-] [-] Servo, please lock down the cabin after I've left and make sure my stuff is loaded to the transport shuttle. [-] [-] Of course, Commander. [-] Goodbye and good luck riding the wave!

Logging private stuff!? Hmpf ....
 T minus 7h 15min [-] [-]Jupiter Outpost 31 (Apollon Station) [-] [-]Lab A [-] [-]Commander [-], Dr. Greyson, Dr. Dawson [-] [-] [-] [-] There you are! What took you so long? [-] [-] Hey Doc! [-] Seems like the internal com has some issues .. [-] again. [-] I just got your assignment note only a few minutes ago. [-] Someone will have to look into this mess tomorrow whe... [-] [-] Sure, sure. [-] Now - let's get started one something important. [-] Timing is key. [-] [-] The tech team has installed the new transceiver that will allow us to track a cosmological event, which happens only every dozen years. [-] We want to pick up that signal and investigate the results, so the fleet can probably make use of the data. [-] Let me quickly check the status. [-] DAVE? [-] [-] Processing requests, doctor. [-] [-] [-] [-] [-] [-] Doc! [-] The wave array is read .. [-] oh, hi [-]! [-] Coming over to help us? [-] [-] Seems so. [-] Something you guys broke .. [-] let me guess .. [-] maybe .. [-] cake in the sequencer again? [-] [-] [-] [-] Ok. [-] Meet you later over at the TITAN! [-] [-] [-] [-] [-] [-] Dr. Greyson? [-] The data has been sent to your terminal. [-] [-] Thanks DAVE. [-] [-] Turns out, your access permission is required to complete the installation, [-]. [-] And, while you're at it, lend these guys a hand since you know best how to work on that system. [-] Chief Kuehn is down in the engine section. [-] [-] Ok Doc, no worries. [-] We'll get this transceiver online in no time..
That's where all this started..
 T minus 3h 10min [-] [-]Jupiter Outpost 31 (Apollon Station) [-] Engine Section [-] [-]Commander [-], Tech Chief Kuehn [-] [-] [-] [-] [-] [-] [-], I told you several times that will not work that way! [-] [-] Hey, at least we had to try it! [-] It seems this whole installation is flawed. [-] This is like trying to put a B-connecor into an A-plug. [-] DAVE, whose idea was this, anyway? [-] Greyson said we have to install this ... [-] and time is running out, she said. [-] Whatever this means. [-] Probably because our shift is over in an hour! [-] [-] [-] [-] Ok, new idea - [-] you will stay here on the console and I will go down to the control core and reboot the whole thing. [-] If that doesn't work... [-] [-] It better does! [-] Ok, I will tell Dawson to check the power level..
I clearly remember what followed..
