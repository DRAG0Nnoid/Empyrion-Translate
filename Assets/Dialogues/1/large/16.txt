Really? That's great to hear... [-] [-]I assume you do want to find or get in touch with your people as quickly as possible. [-] [-]I'll send a runner to reach out to our friends, so they are informed about your arrival. [-] In the meantime, [-] I would like to ask you for some help on a pretty [-] .. unpleasant topic, we were not able to solve on our own. [-]Our suffering might sound miniscule to you, [-] but let me explain. [-] Our crop fields are repeatedly getting attacked by spider-like creatures. [-] [-]They pop into existence around the nearby [-]ancient tower[-], attacking our workers. [-]They are threatening our settlements, frightening our women and children. [-] We were of course able to fend off these creatures each time they showed up. [-] [-]But it won't end! [-] [-]If anything, the frequency of their appearance has gradually increased in the last weeks. [-] A few days ago, we sent a group of warriors to find out about the reason for this to happen. [-]But they never returned. [-] [-]So did the group of men that was sent to help them. [-] What we know so far: [-] All seems to have started some months ago. [-] [-]That century old [-]ancient tower[-] nearby this settlement suddenly came to .. [-] unholy life. [-]Inside the tower, there are several plates with inscriptions.[-] [-]We were not able to understand them completely, but the elders say they are talking about a war. [-]Long ago and forgotten as it seems. [-] We only have some child-frightening stories about a threat that is sleeping in the ground. [-] [-]But looking at what is happening around us right now, what is threatening our people and the wasted, irradiated areas of death that suddenly grew into this land.. [-]The Elders' Council is highly concerned! [-] Each day this riddle is not solved, might turn the tides against us.  [-] The Zirax Empire garrison commander on this planet did not listen to us. [-]  [-]They do not even recognize this strange kind of .. [-] unholy terraforming as a threat. [-] And the Polaris scientists do not dare to officially show up here anymore. [-]Polaris officials haven't been seen outside their stations a lot anymore, since the Zirax soldiers started to kidnap them to extort the company for ransom..
The ancients be praised! [-] [-]You will find the [-]ancient tower[-] nearby this settlement.  [-]Maybe you can find out what happened to our warriors and what is the root cause of this menace. [-] Before you go, please [-]head over to our trader[-]. [-]Your people have left behind some equipment. [-] [-]Make good use of it! [-]May the voices of the past protect you, friend..
I will find out what is happening..
Hello, my friend! [-]The chief told me to hand over some equipment they dropped in my junk box a few months ago.[-]A flamethrower and some ammo for it. [-] This is nothing a real Talon warrior would ever use. [-] But I am sure you can make good use of it, when eliminating the creatures coming from that monument tower. [-] [-]This is an older model, so [-]do not aim too close[-] at the ground or at your feet to avoid harming yourself.[-]May the voices of the past be with you..
[-]What's this about other terrans?[-].
Hm.. strange you did not yet run into them while you survived on this planet for so long .. [-] [-] Polaris Megacorp is running their business throughout the galaxy. [-] [-]They are the biggest company in the exploration, mining and resources business. [-]They have some relationship with the Zirax, but this is more a fragile state of at least not shooting at each other right away. [-] The Polaris scientists are very interested in what happens here on this planet and in this system .. [-] but as the Zirax activities on and around that planet have increased in the last months, we have rarely seen them. [-]They are still running a quite impressive outpost, the '[-]Sanctuary[-]',  somewhere on this planet and delivering goods to our settlements .. [-] secretly of course. [-] The Zirax Empire, on the other hand, still runs a [-]full garrison[-] on this planet. [-] [-]This whole system seems to be really important to them. [-] Although not important enough they would really care for their troops well being. [-] Seems to be more of an outpost you cannot decide to be sent to [-] .. if you know what I mean. [-] They are understaffed, underpaid, relying on extremely old equipment .. [-] and occasionally come over to .. [-] borrow some supplies.. [-].[-]They are not friends with your people at all, and will shoot at them as soon as they see a terran in their scopes. [-] [-]Be careful when you run into them. [-] We are confident you will find answers against all these odds! [-] [-]You have survived on this planet for so long. [-] [-]You have the experience we need to solve this. [-] [-]So, will you help us?.
Sure. You help me, so I help you..
[-]Tell about inscription plates[-].
Bi'phuan, friend!  [-] I heard from the chief.. [-] oh .. [-] this injury looks serious! [-] Let's not waste time! [-]You need to craft an [-]Antitoxic Ointment[-] and apply it. [-] Otherwise this dermal parasite will soon evolve into lot of little Endo Parasites. [-]Head over to the [-]trader [-]and [-]get [-]me 1x AlienTooth, 1x Herbal Leaves and 1x Plant Protein..
Bi'phuan, friend! [-] [-]Please have this scrambler protocol installed to your suit com module. [-] This way we and our allies can reach out to you more easily. [-] [-]Check your PDA ([-]F1[-]) frequently for new communications and missions. [-] The chief also wants me to hand you over something my father found a decade ago in a crashed ship. [-] [-]It is an ancient warrior bow .. [-] but it has been modified with some nice extras. [-] I think you will like it when you run into a Zirax patrol anytime soon. [-] [-]Have fun, friend and may the voices of the past guide you..
Awesome! Thanks a lot!.
Hello stranger! [-]May the voices of the past lead you to wisdom. [-]How may we help you?.
I am eager to help!.
My sensors indicate there is a [-]mechanism[-] behind the wall nearby. [-] [-]It seems to be linked to a device which ought to .. manage .. the stations functions. [-]Suggestion: [-] Destroy the wall. [-] It should be weak enough that pressing against it will crush it. [-]Then [-]activate the mechanism.[-].
Stranger, no time for long discussions! [-] [-]The containment system is failing! [-] [-]Tell my people! [-] I am specialist Kar'han! [-] Chief [-] officer of ... [-] the Talon-Zirax Assembly......
No time for chatter! [-] [-]I am feeling the Legacy already growing inside ... [-] ...[-]Oh. [-] I now remember. [-] [-]My brain already seems to be getting dysfunctional. [-] I am infected! [-] [-]This is a cryo-containment facility... [-] ... [-] Listen, stranger, [-] whoever you are, [-] you need to get out of here now! [-] [-]The Legacy has infested this place ... [-] and me. [-] [-]The Zirax will kill anyone who comes in contact with it. [-] I wonder why this prison cell is even still here ... [-] [-]I'm certain the self-destruct sequence is already activated..
Then ... [-] What are you waiting for! [-] We don't have a lot of time left! [-] [-]The Legacy is seizing this world. [-] The Infinite Life Program has failed. [-] [-]The Zirax scum have nothing better to do than arrest all the science officers! [-] [-]Quick - we need to get out of here!.
Bi'phuah! [-] Who are you? [-] Some new Zirax scum? [-]This isn't some high-value-target prison with some comfort to ex... [-]Oh ... [-] You don't look like a Zirax!.
The Goddess be praised! [-] [-]You are alive! [-] [-]Were you able to find a trace of the expedition?.
Oh, that's not good. [-] [-]This is actually worse than we expected. [-]But thanks to you, we at least have a definitive answer about what happened .. [-] do we?.
Interesting .. they say: [-]The Legacy once ruled all the worlds of this galaxy. [-] Worlds fell apart and into silence, but the honorable Zirax, with the Infinite Life Program, were able to end the threat once and for all, and it might never return. [-] Praise the High Command![-].
Hmm ... I do believe the damage was done on purpose. [-] The glorious past. [-] The Assembly. [-] The Legacy. [-] [-]A tale of the past. [-] A child-frightening story about a big threat. Emptying the inhabited worlds and ending a whole dynasty. [-] Destroying a millennium of peace and prosperity ....
The name Kar'han is still well known in the tales of our tribe. [-] [-]He is known as The First Warrior, fighting the oppression of the Zirax. [-] [-]But these ... tales ... are hundreds of years old. I doubt they are entirely true.  [-] Excuse me, friend. [-] These are disturbing revelations. [-] [-]A long-forgotten menace might just raised its dreadful head again and seems to be already here and infecting our people. [-] This is ... [-] [-]I'll have to speak to the Elders' Council. [-] In the meantime, [-] if you might, ... [-] the council would like to encourage you to help us with some other, ah, problems. [-] [-]Also speak to our [-]Blacksmith[-]. [-] He might be able to help you with your equipment.  [-] [-]May the voices of the past protect you, friend..
Your people came here about a year ago. [-] [-]They seem to have fought with the Zirax patrols in orbit and some of their vessels crashed on this planet. [-]We helped them survive until they were able to escape. [-] So, please pardon our curiosity [-] ... [-] but what are YOU still doing here? [-] [-]How did you manage to escape the Zirax patrols for so long?.
