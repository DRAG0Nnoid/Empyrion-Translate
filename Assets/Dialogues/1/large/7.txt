Someday Polaris Corp will own the galaxy..
Competition is a good thing! I mean, do you see anyone else here?.
Welcome to our small establishment stranger!.
Be careful of the pirates, they are known to take slaves..
This galaxy is full of opportunity!.
The Zirax make finding a new home challenging..
I wonder how far it is to the nearest trader station?.
Someday the galaxy will be at peace again..
Colonization is an incredible adventure!.
The forest whispers at night. I am glad we have our security fences in place..
The remnants of the War of Silence can be felt everywhere, even on this planet..
You say you are a Terran? I have not heard of your species. How is your Zirax prefect?.
I do not believe that you are from another galaxy. Go peddle your lies elsewhere..
I heard a rumor that a new Empire has surfaced to challenge the Zirax! They call themselves the Kriel..
Our ship is a modest one, but she is adventure-ready!.
I hope we do not run into any pirates..
The pirates are constantly setting traps. Only last week my kin barely escaped one!.
Be sure you pay your right-to-travel fees or the Zirax will impound your ship!.
The galactic currency is the credit..
I hear there are civilizations that destroy themselves with environmental disasters. Who would ever be so foolish as to do that?.
We take what we want..
The slaves sound restless, better fetch the electro-rod..
Your ship looks, nice....
The damn Zirax drove us to this fetid state..
I will not succumb to poverty, if the galactic powers will not help us then we will help ourselves..
Where is Zaxks? I swear, if he spent another credit on the Trilinithane....
It was either this, or the rebellion, and the rebellion does not pay very well..
Scavenging is far better than my old job!.
Smuggling is challenging with the Zirax, but is even worse with the Kriel..
We may end up helping the Zirax against the Kriel. Hives are not good for business..
I never pay any taxes..
Our black market is the real power in the galaxy..
Your crew, how much would you want for them?.
When you cannot eat, you steal..
We do not have a leader, we have each other..
If the galactic powers keep driving a divide, we will eventually rule the galaxy!.
Send a thief to catch a thief, unless they already stole your wallet..
Beware the Polaris. They play with powers they do not comprehend..
The Abyssal are the only Zirax we fear and if you have any sense you will fear them too..
The traders guild are the real crooks of the galaxy!.
I have 257 days off every year..
Survival has a way of turning the most civilized being into the most bloodthirsty of savages..
Pssst, want some Tril?.
Rob from the rich and give to, us!.
All for one and one for, us!.
That is a nice weapon, you say it 'fires' something? Why would you need to set fire to something when you can project energy?.
You are weak, and your survivor stuff will be ours..
Terrans, rare. You will fetch a high price!.
Your fleet will soon be stripped and your parts will adorn our ships!.
The Trade federation will be swept aside in our advance!.
The Polaris are parasites, to be removed with the most fervent of energies..
The universe will be ours!.
Only a primitive civilization would allow for pirates!.
We birth the greatest soldiers!.
The UCH will be our vassal!.
Our birthing pools never sleep..
You reek of inferiority..
We are the superior race..
Our ships and bases are of superior design!.
We will sweep all before us!.
Music is for primates..
Warm blood is inferior..
The Zirax are nothing compared to us!.
We will not make the same mistake and wake the great silence..
Our past speaks of great times ahead. We must be ready..
We are the rightful inheritors of the progenitors!.
Our god is the 'Great Designer'. He is named the Ja'Ran'da'll.
I am coming from a planet that you could not survive on..
Our home planet is beautiful!.
Nicommon! Bejut ka re mol..

You know?!... [-]  There's a couple pilots inside who could probably give you a tip or two about handling that wreck you call a ship!.... [-].
My piloting skills are just fine thank you, and I happen to like my ship, I just need some more parts.....
Not if I'm done with them they won't, Can I use the Repair Bay instead?.
So, [-]  did you talk with them already? [-].
No!.... I just need parts......
I will, can I use the Repair Bay in the meantime?.
Yeah sure!... [-]  It's only 2000 credits but you'll have to feed the Ingots into the Console yourself! [-].
2000 Credits?!... Damn!.. Ok, I guess!....
2000 Credits?!... Damn!.. I'll fix it myself thank you!.
Ok.... Hold on.... [-] Here, take the Card to use it! [-] [-]The repair bay it's the one with the sign over it, you can't miss it! [-]  [-]Ho and, [-] you can use it as long as you want!... [-] Just don't lose that key card! [-].
Our last raid was epic! [-].
Skaar's buffoons are no match for us!... [-].
I have the fastest skiff in the sector! [-].
A Skiff?!?... How do you?.... Nevermind....
You need someone dead?!.... [-].
Herr... No thank you, I'm cool....
Do you want in on a million deal?!.... [-].
You'd be the last one I would trust on that!....
Those Polaris freighters are an easy picking!... [-].
Damn!... [-] I need coin again!... [-] Gotta stop gambling! [-].
I just came into possession of some humm... [-]  misplaced [-]  jewelry that I need to part ways with!... [-]An one time deal!... [-] [-] You're in? [-].
I bet you did, yeah.... But thanks, it wouldn't look good on me!.....
You want in on our next big heist to a Polaris freighter?!... [-].
I would feel better if they don't even know we're having this little chat....
Get lost punk!... [-].
Showing up in here all by yourself?... [-] You have a death wish?... [-].
Don't trust those Zirax deserters! [-]  They're up to no good!... [-].
I trust no one!.....
Lost your way kid? [-].
Showing up in here all by yourself? [-] You're really brave! [-]  Or real stupid! [-].
Ha Ha Ha!... [-] We got a nosy rookie here guys? [-]  Who needs the deck clean?!... [-].
Ho, great, found the comedian!.
You're the new scrub?! [-] [-]The toilet is clogged again!... [-].
You guys are beginning to rub me the wrong way!....

Yeah, right, I'm [-]!... Say can I ask you a couple questions?!....
Treasure?!?.... There's a Treasure in here?!?.....
Ok!... [-] Listen kid! [-] I know nothing about no treasure!... [-]  [-]And if I were you [-] I would tread very carefully around here... [-]  [-]I wouldn't even mention something like that! [-]  [-]Not everyone around here is as nice as I am you know!.... [-].
What?!... [-]  No!... What you mean?!... [-] [-] What is it that you want anyway [-]? [-].
I'm just looking for a guy named Yarod, you know him?.

[-] [-]I also mean that literally, [-] He went looking for some stuff in one of the caves here and was never seen again!... [-]  [-]What is he to you anyway? [-].
I... humm... Was asked to find him!... But what was he looking for?.....
No idea kid, [-]  but every time he came here he would stare at that symbol [-] there near the window! [-].
So!.. What's with that symbol?!....
Dunno kid,   what I can tell you is that every bum that stumbled upon here asking questions about that thing went missing!... [-] [-]And there's others like that spread around this place!... [-] [-]Anyway, [-] he used to work in the Mineral Lab. [-] [-]Maybe he left something there, who knows?! [-].
Ok, thank you!... I'll check the lab then!....
