Commander, the night is coming and you also need something to eat. [-]I have analyzed the nearby plants. Most of them should be edible.

[-]Defence[-] [-]Use this mode for defending against small animals.

[-]Note: make use of your personal drone ([-]F5[-]) for mining underground deposits to avoid getting trapped in a deep mining hole. [-]Salvage[-] [-]Use this mode for recovering usable materials from wrecks. With the Survival Tool you cannot regain the full amount of materials or components, but only a fraction.

Any additional logs available?.
I am afraid this is all of it.  All the other logs are either destroyed or heavily fragmented. [-]Commander .. there might be something wrong about even this log. [-]The timestamp of the message is of .. [-] tomorrow [-] .. and at the same time, the log file indicates that it was created one year ago! [-]That does not add up at all..
The log is clearly made by someone from the UCH with the personal ID 19893-M. [-]I have validated the ID, but without access to the UCH fleet database, I cannot find out who is behind that ID. [-]Nevertheless, we can be quite sure that a vessel from the Operation Phoenix fleet crashed here for yet unknown reasons. [-] We can assume that those Zirax might have something to do with it. [-] If it was a fight or technical trouble cannot be said for sure. [-] I assume it might have happened in combat, as this could also be a reason why no one else is here. Neither the TITAN, nor anyone else of the fleet. [-] They have probably moved on or escaped..
This is indeed strange, but can possibly be explained. [-]The scientific reason why we did not arrive on the same day as the fleet: [-] we were not fully enclosed by the TITAN's warp vortex [-] and some gravitational instabilities have affected us similar to the time dilation effects near a black hole. [-]Another, more obvious reason could be that, due to the damage of this station and the console, the timestamp and the log entries are simply damaged and faulty..
Either way,  we will have to find more info. [-] We need to [-]find the Small Settlement[-] of the Talon. [-] The message indicates those people might know more about what happened to the survivor that left this message here. [-] I will set a [-]marker onto your hud[-]. [-]Before we leave, I strongly suggest to unlock an [-]Assault Rifle[-] or the [-]Shotgun[-] from the Techtree ([-]F3[-]) and craft them in the Portable Constructor..
Sounds like a plan..
