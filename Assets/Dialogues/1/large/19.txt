Commander, [-] our new Talon friends have just sent us the position of a large crashed vessel. [-]They suspect it is one of ours, as some of the survivors came from its direction, they say. [-] There is one caveat, though. [-] We need to take into account what the Talon Chief said.[-] The survivors came to this settlement a year ago. [-] This might indicate that the console we found that message was not broken .. [-] but we have lost one year while being dragged to Andromeda ....
Yeah. We will need to find out more about that...
Either way, we will have to find more info. [-] [-]I suggest to head for the [-]Small Settlement[-] of the Talon. [-] [-]The message indicates those people might know more about what happened to the survivor that left this message here..
Sounds like a plan..
Absolutely. [-]But before we go any further, I recommend using the [-]Damaged Com Station[-] to our advantage. [-] It is situated in a relatively safe area without the risk of running into Zirax patrols. [-] You should upgrade it into a real base and gear up a little. [-] [-]What do you think?.
Good idea! [-](Tutorial - Base Building)[-].
Not now.  [-](Story - Find wreckage)[-].
Well done, Commander![-]You have now laid the foundation, but there are still a few things to know.[-]For all the advanced topics and more details about how to do farming, how to oxygenate your base, how to handle large devices without using your inventory (Logistics Network) and other important knowledge, [-]please check the Empyriopedia[-] ([-]F1[-]).[-] You should now be ready to go to the [-]wreckage [-]position the Talon sent us. [-]If you do not feel ready yet, you should spend some more time preparing your equipment. [-] [-]We will for sure be running into angry Zirax troopers..
No time to explain that in detail at the moment, my friend. [-] Everything you need to know for now: [-] the Legacy invaded this sea of stars in the distant past. [-] It was just about defeated after a war that had most of the inhabited worlds falling into the besaid silence. [-] The Legacy is not about conquering territory like the Zirax or Kriel. [-] It is pure .. [-] destruction .. [-] of some strange kind .. [-] Ok, more about that at a later time. [-] I just got a message from my organization for YOU. [-] Now forwarding...[-] We'll speak later again. [-] May the voices of the past protect you, my friend..
Integrated Data Assistant (IDA).
Commander. [-] Agent Kezzel forwarded a message from an unknown source. [-]The message is decoded already..
Show me the message, please..
