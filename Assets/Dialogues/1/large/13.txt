Scientific reports made during the War of Silence indicate that the LEGACY is a semi-material entity, bound to some structures in the real world. Usually these structures were holding a certain amount of Pentaxid element before they were converted to some radioactive alien metal (no data available). The LEGACY itself is not the sum of all the transformed biological beings under its control - not like a bee hive - but the sum of the energy it stole from them. [-] The exact method of this stealing process has not been found, but the investigations indicate that an infecting particle is somehow transferring the energetic spirit of any higher life form to a local pool of the entity. The local pools aggregate into 'Hive Nuclei'. When a Nucleus is strong enough, a local entity, referred to as 'hive mind' is created. This hive mind then tries to get in touch with other hive minds on nearby Nexus worlds. It also sends out ships that seed the 'Legacy particles' on new worlds.[-] It was found that the Legacy particle can only infect higher beings, but not animals or lower lifeforms. The particle does actually infect lower lifeforms, but dies without gaining control or being able to transform them. The controlling of infected higher lifeforms is a side effect, though. They are used as cannon fodder for the LEGACY. The hives are not weakened by killing these Infected. It only slows down the spread of the Legacy Particle. This knowledge was used by the Ghyst and the Xenu for the Infinite Life Forms (ILF) weapon (created by the Serdu), - after the destruction of several planets with conventional weapons did not succeed. [-] The ILF was deployed on many worlds, creating a myriad of unintelligent, lower lifeforms. The theory was that the LEGACY could be 'dried out' or at least distracted, while spending more and more effort to compensate for the loss of its Legacy Particles, while conventional weapons destroy their hives. This strategy seems to have been successful as the Legacy was pushed back to the edge of the galaxy. The War of Silence officially ended 900 years ago..
Is there evidence that the LEGACY was destroyed?.
I am afraid this information was removed from the archives, your excellency. The information is not available..
Interesting. Can you tell me something about the Zirax Empire?.
The glorious Zirax Empire was founded about 800 years ago, after the treachery of the Talon led to a civil war. The Talon-Zirax assembly was dissolved as a result and the Zirax Empire was born. It was founded by the most influential houses of the Zirax: The Xenu, the Ghyst, Rados, Epsilon, Serdu and Abyssal. The first empress was a member of the house of Serdu. In the beginning, this changed with nearly each new royal election. The last two centuries, the empress has always been a member of the House of Abyssal, though..
Hm .. can you tell me more about the Talon treachery?.
Even before the War of Silence, the Zirax houses did all the dirty work for the Talon-Zirax assembly. When the War of Silence came to its end, evidence was found by the Xenu  that the Talon might have initiated the war intentionally to weaken the houses and overtake the rulership. Ghyst specialists found out that the Talon were using similar tech than the ships of the LEGACY and that they seem to have come from the same spot outside of this galaxy. The high court of the houses decided that, after the dust of war settled down, to disempower these traitors for the good of all biological beings. [-] Most of the Talon did not escape their deserved punishment and were enslaved or sent to reservations. There have been reports of a refugee fleet having fled into deep space. The glorious Zirax Empire is well aware about that and always ready to withstand their attack - or anyone else's..
Ok, I think I have heard enough. Is there a possibility to download that archive?.
This can only be done by a member of the House of Abyssal and the Keeper of the Staff of Guidance. Please put both  insignia in the scanning device in front of you..

Glad you made it out alive. I heard the Xenu have destroyed the archive. I'll make sure they get their payback for that.[-]Did you find what you were searching for?.
Yes, but there are a few things that do not fit. The Talon being traitors?.
Yeah, I expected that you would find this questionable. But you need to know, the archive was created by my ancestors and only with the view of the glorious Empire in mind.  Let me fill in some blanks and clarify a few details. [-] The 'evidence' the Xenu and the Ghyst found about the Talon having set up the War of Silence was already heavily disputed at that time. The specialist of the House of Abyssal later found out, that the evidence was made up, faked or only half the truth. BUT, at this point no one did care, because the Houses have decided to take over the control. So they just used this reason - and everyone won. Except the Talon. A lot of the members of the Academy of Sciences were killed or imprisoned. But also a lot of the Talon, at least more than the Empire will admit, have fled into deep space. But never returned. [-] One thing of the evidence found back then seems to be correct: the Talon did use a similar tech than the LEGACY ships. Even the shapes of the ships were nearly identical. Also the weapons. And they came from a distant galaxy, Triangulum as you call it, as refugees as we found out. So there actually IS a connection between the Talon and the LEGACY. We just haven't found out what it is. I am feeling, we are so close....
Don't want to hold you off from anything, but I have a pressing mission....
Of course. And we will start with this right now! As promised, my spies have located the prison complex. It is located in [-] .. hold on a second. [-] We are getting an emergency report!.
I have a bad feeling...
Commander, seems like your GLaD organization has a traitor in its crew. I just received a message that a small GHYST task force will depart in a few hours towards the GLaD outpost .. with the order to destroy everything. No prisoners. You should head back asap, find that traitor and get rid of that problem. Otherwise our operation to free your comrades might end before we even started...  I will be here and see what I can prepare until then. Good Luck, my friend..
Of course I am!.
Yes, indeed. I am the humble Keeper of the Archives of the glorious House of Abyssal. [-] And although you do not seem to be of my creator's kind, you are the honorable Keeper of the Staff of Guidance .. [-] and you also hold a seal of the House of Abyssal! [-]Please forgive me my inexcusable ignorance, your excellency. How may I serve you?.
Do the Archives hold any info about the terms VOID, TESCH or PROGENITOR?.

Commander, I am sure you are aware we cannot simply go to Mercer and tell him about what Hyzani said. He could be the traitor as well. Given how his father was possibly fooling the whole operation...
Prejudices, IDA? But you are right. We do not know who we need to watch out for..
I suggest not revealing what we just did and what we learned. Given the mission parameters we can just say it was a trap and had to fight our way out of it. And listen to what he says about it..
Yes, that's the plan. No worries, I will be cautious..
[-]  I am afraid, Sir. Commander Mercer is currently in a .. ehm .. private meeting. I cannot let you in. But you can wait here until he is done..
Ah.. ok. I will wait here.  [-](whispers) IDA?[-].
[-] I know what you are trying to ask for, but I am not able to hack into the communication from here. But.. [-] Oh, wait a second. Something I learned from the Sigma station. [-] So, please try again, IDA![-] We are in! Decoding com signal. Ready for transmission..
[-] [-] .. have no other choice if we want to get this New Eden project going. [-] [-] And I am sure you do not want to face the consequences, correct? [-] [-] Of course not, sir, but what about Lamarr, Zerogen and the others? [-] [-] Commander! What did I just say? Did you listen to my words? [-] [-] Sure, but in case Commander [-] find out what we did, we..[-] [-] That won't be your problem anymore in a few hours.[-] [-] Did you make sure the cargo is untouched? [-] [-] Yes, they are secured in our lower dock. [-] [-] Good. [-] [-] Make sure that no one is putting his dirty hands on them. [-] [-] Do not stand in the way of my employees and you will be fine. [-] [-] Affirmative, sir..
Interesting. I am afraid the clock is working against us..
[-] Com disconnected. I saved a copy for Yarod. He will try to analyze the voice and the other data that were hidden in the stream..
Seems we are becoming a good team..
Commander! You are back already! What happened?.
As we expected, only a trap of the Zirax I am afraid..
Damn. That is no good news. But no worries, our agents will find Commander Lamarr and the team!.
Sure. You seem to have been busy with meetings. Good news?.
