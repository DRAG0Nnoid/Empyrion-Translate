Sure... Let me see!.....
Hummm... [-]  My head still aches from last night.... [-].
Watch your back in here!... [-]  Not everyone is as nice as I am! [-].
Are you talking to me?!... [-] There's no one else here!... [-].
Thank you!... You're awfully helpful for a pirate!....
Pirate?!... Ho no!... [-] I'm no pirate!... [-] [-]They just... [-]  Hummm. [-] Made me an offer I could not refuse!... [-]  [-]Anyway, plenty of common folk like me do the menial tasks around the base!... [-]  [-]Some of them pirates are pretty laxed but don't trust us with nothing either!... [-].
Hey, Ben?... Could you please repeat what you said about Yarod?!.....
Kid!... [-] Not sure what you came here for but... [-] Are you sure you are up to this? [-] Guys around here don't take it well with nosy foreigners!... [-]  [-]Anyway, [-] Yarod used to work at the Mineral Lab, [-] can't tell you exactly what he did there but the boss seemed to appreciate it.... [-] until a couple weeks back that is.... [-] [-]Not sure what happened.... [-] The lab is through the hangar, up the lift on the left.... [-] He also had a room in the dorm, not sure which one but ask Zaall at the Cafeteria there, he may know!.... [-].
Ok, thanks once again!....
Hey Ben!... What do you have today?....
We took this station from the Polaris hands and put it to good use!...  [-] Suckers!..... [-] He He He... [-].
This place is a gold mine!.... [-].
Those Polaris suckers are still trying to get this place back!... [-] He He He!... Losers!.... [-].
Say!.... [-] You're not one of those Polaris spies are you?!?... [-].
You smell like Polaris scum!... [-] Are you?!?.... [-].
Sick!....[-]  Sick!.... [-] So sick of these guard shifts!.... [-].
Who're you?!... [-] What you want?!?.... [-].
A couple more coins and I'll have my own skiff!... [-] Yeah!... [-] No more guard shifts for me!.... [-].
[-] You're a willing patient?!.... [-]  [-] Hummm!.... [-] Never treated one of your kind before!.... [-] Not that it matters much anyway!... [-] I should be able to cut you up and sew you down all the same!.... [-] [-]Yeah!... [-] No problem, lay on the table right there!...[-].
Hell No!.... Thank you I'm good!....
So?!... [-] What is it that you want then? [-].
Just to see your goods!.....
Sure!... [-] For a price of course! [-] It's 3000 credits. [-] [-]But you'll be able to use any Med Station and O2 Station around this place!... [-].
Ungrateful punks!... [-] [-]It's no easy task keeping those things working in a place like this so you know!... [-]  [-]Here!... [-] Just keep it with you if you want to use them!.... [-].
You guys waste no chance to make coins around here I see!.... Sure let me have it!....
Can I see your goods Doc?!....
Say, can I use your Med Station?!.....
I'll manage myself without it thank you!....
Hey!.... [-] How are you feeling today? [-].
[-] Hummm.... [-] A Human?!?... [-] Coming here willingly?!?.... [-] That's new!.... [-].
[-] All of your kind that came through here ended up down there in the cells!.... [-] [-]But if I were you I would not test my luck!... [-] [-]We ran out of cell blocks already,  we would have to find a new end for you!.... [-] He He He... [-].
What a welcoming thought!, What did they do to end up in there?....
Ho, nothing really,[-] they were just in the wrong place at the wrong time... [-] [-]They were aboard a Polaris freighter by the time we .. [-] decided we needed to replace it's crew!.... He He He [-] [-]You guys are so uncommon around these parts that the captain thought they were worth a good ransom!... [-] Big mistake!... [-] He He He [-].
So, why are the human inmates in the cells for?.
Was this a Research Station?.
Wasn't this a research station?... How come you have prison cells in here?.
That's what Polaris wanted everyone to believe!... [-] [-]We came to know they were installing machinery capable of synthesized rare ores... [-]  Hummm... [-] Replica alloys, lets say... [-] In our own backyard of all places!.... [-]We were far more easier going back then and they were probably thinking of making us a proxy to sell out those ores!.... [-] [-]Our boss at the time decided we were going to be no one's lackey and we took over the station as soon as the machinery was installed!... [-] [-]Thieves' luck made it so that their top scientist had a grudge against them!... [-] He He He... [-] [-]He's been making far more coins since he started working for us!.... [-].
Not sure I'm safe now that I know that!.
Ho, no worries... [-] We make good coins for everyone involved!... [-] [-]Only Polaris is at a loss here but it's their own fault taking us for fools in the first place! [-].
Can I see what you're selling.
I don't usually trade with outsiders but, [-] everyone around here get's far better stuff by raiding Polaris so, yeah sure... [-].
Can I see what you're selling.
Ho good, Polaris rejected stolen property, I should get a good price!....
I sure am!... [-] [-]And you sure know how to make an entrance!... [-] [-]I'm just not that sure you ever gonna make it out of this place!... [-].
I've seen worse!... Anyway, do you know where is Prof Yarod?.
I doubt that batshit crazy himself knew where he was most of his awaken hours!... [-] [-]Regardless, you've wrecked your way through this place looking for him?.... [-] [-]Not sure what kind of coin whoever sent you here said he was going to give you, [-] but I assure you [-] he does not have enough!.... [-].
Well... Coin is not everything!... Do you know or what?.
Brave last words!... [-] [-]No, no idea, but you can check his room... [-] [-]It's the level above us at the end I think!... [-].
What's on the menu today?.
All the best Polaris freighters kindly drop at our doorsteps!... [-].
