Ah.. the meeting .. no. Nothing really important.  Trying to get a better price for our supplies from Polaris, you know.. ha, ha.. Eh.. why don't you have a quick rest. Our bartender has some good stuff. And if you want to have a quick nap, the crew quarters are just up the elevator next to the bar.  Excuse me. I need to make a few preparations for the next .. mission. See you later..
Commander! Commander? This is you?  .. aahrg....
Ok, so how can I help you?.
I am .. aaaaahr ... i am.. the Ilmarinen .. Container .. aaaah this hurts so bad .. Commander .. quick .. Mercer .. see Palant. Loading dock on the lower level .. she needs to know .. uhhhaaa .. others ....
Henrid. Open the door!  You need a medibot ....
Commander! You need to report that to Mercer ASAP!.
Wait IDA. Do you hear anything? I just shot a weapon in here and no alarm...
That is .. true. I am also not getting any signals from the internal alarm system. It seems to be .. offline!.
We need to go to the loading dock and speak Palant - asap!.
Commander, what are you doing here? I am afraid I have no time for you right now. I need to check...
Let me guess. These containers?.
Yes .. how did you know? Ok, anyways.  If you ask me, we should throw these containers Henrid brought to the base right out of the airlock again. I am measuring emissions coming from the inside..
Did they start just recently?.
Yes. Started a few minutes ago..
Where are all the guards?.
Commander Mercer has sent them to restock their ammo - he said he is preparing a new mission. I need to find Henrid. He did not respond to my call..
Oh .. I think he won't respond. He is dead..
He is.. what? You are kidding. I spoke to him an hour ago. He said he does not feel well and went to the crew quarters. That's not good timing for jokes..
Not a joke, but you need to know that....
Commander! For god sake - you just rescued my life. I owe you everything!.
Ok, so what just happened here?.
Seems like someone revealed our position to the Ghyst and they have sent a battle group right away - this is really bad.[-]And now .. we have no other choice as to destroy that base and retreat to the nearby UCH outpost..
The Ghyst, eh..? That's an interesting coincidence..
What? Yes. I have grabbed his command card - here, you can possibly make use of it![-]I have set up the self destruction. Palant and Emmerson seem to have already evacuated the crew..
What about those containers in the hangar? I have just shot some...
The containers .. I am not sure what you mean. Listen, we can talk later. A larger battlegroup is already underway. [-]Go  upstairs to the entry door. There is a [-]security door [-]on the left. I'll unlock it for you. The self destruction lever is in the room behind it. [-]Purge the base. I'll send you the coordinates for the next rallypoint. Good Luck, Commander..
If you say this .. Commander..
Commander, did you find the traitor?.
Depends. I might have, but I also failed to protect the outpost..
Oh - sad to hear this. But I have some good news about your imprisoned friends. I have worked out a plan that should work..
Didn't you say we need to get hold of the traitor at first?.
I think that you interfered with their plans enough so they will be distracted a while. This is where we can start our own operation.[-]I assume you found a Ghyst command card when defeating the Ghyst troops?.
How do you .. ? Yes, I got one..
Perfect. That will make things a lot easier, because no one will deactivate that card for the near future. The communication ways are long in the Empire. We can use this to our avantage.  With the card we have a valid code to open the hangar doors of the Prison .. but we need to arrange some turmoil, so the local forces are distracted..
So, how do we start?.
Find the asteroid field in the solar system with the prison. The system is marked on your map with '[-]High Security[-]'. Find the spot where the Zirax and Kriel territory nearly touch. A few clicks behind the Zirax border, there should be the system. Find and warp to the local [-]asteroid field[-]. Go there and wait for my orders..
I better stock up my ammo first....
You are.. here! This isn't an illusion .. oh my god .. I did not even dare to...
Alex! Yes I am here! What the hell happened...
Our mission was compromised. It was a trap. We warped in the system and the Ghyst had a whole battlegroup to welcome us..
No, Mercer is most likely dead. And his son .. no way. He did not even know what we were up to. It is someone else. Either working with or even from inside the UCH. Someone who seems to have gained a lot of influence in the last months. We had some company yesterday. They sedated us, but I heard they were speaking about us. And one of them was a terran. Without doubt. We will find that traitor. I now know his voice!.
Ok, so first of all, we need to get you and Jennifer out of here..
Wait! We cannot go alone. You will never believe who came in last week. A Talon! But not one of those tribal guys you have possibly met. This one is wearing a tech suit and looks different. We need to free him as well! They brought him into the security cell over there! His name is Tharkan..
Ok, I will see what I can do. I'll be right back..
Hello Friend, you seem to be a trustable person coming here to rescue us. This is your wife over in that cell?.
You have good ears, my friend..
Oh, thanks a lot. I am trying my best..
Before the Ghyst are finding out what we do here .. may I ask a question?.
The suit you are wearing indicates you are not from this part of the galaxy .. or a Talon?.
I see you are not new to some of the secrets of this galaxy. So, for now, I am actually a Talon. And I think saying that, you have already drawn an interesting conclusion of where I am coming from. I hope you will consider taking me with you so we can share some information. It might be .. important for the survival of the galaxy. Mine and yours..
Sounds familiar.  Wait for the signal. We'll start soon..
Commander! I was already worried ...
I need your help, your excellency..
Sure thing. What do you need me to do?.
I am quite sure you already have a vessel close to the Prison..
I see you start to get to know how I work. Ha. Great.  Of course - the vessel is ready. Let me know where you need it and when..
Bring it to the side of the asteroid where the prison cells are..
The vessel is underway. What is the signal?.
I will overload a converter and make a nice hole, you need to seal immediately..
No problem. Just one question. Is there also a Talon called Tharkan?.
Why am I not surprised? We will rescue all prisoners. Not only our people..
No, that's too far fetched..
No really. Everything hurts .. I am not sure if...

[-]Strange incident observed in Ellyon system [-]A farmer of the local Talon tribe reported to our newsagent Ellias, that while he was drying his clothes not far from the [-] site, a bright blue light flashed the sky.
