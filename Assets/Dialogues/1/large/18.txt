Oh no, not that again. [-] Gosh. [-] I am not his personal secretary he can send his minions to .. [-] I am the commander of this fricking station surrounded by .. [-] Ah, forget about it. [-] ... [-]Please go back to the elevator and one level up. [-]Find his assistant [-]Kezzel [-]up there .. somewhere. [-] He manages the equipment of the Doctor. [-]While you are at it, tell him that he shall make sure that this time nothing is left here..
Will do. Thanks a lot..
So... [-] [-]Doctor Mandor has sent you over, to bring me some precious presents, so valuable that he gave them to a .. [-] stranger? [-]What you are carrying around might be a key element to understand what is going on  here and....
How is the doctor?.
No worries. [-] He is fine. [-] The extraction team has picked him up. [-] Back to topic. [-]What about this data he was so excited about?.
[-]Hand over Space Anomalies Report[-].
Hm.. these are encrypted. [-] Will take a while. [-] Security measures, you know. [-] Our .. Zirax friends might not even have understood whom they had in their filthy hands... [-]Something else?.
[-]Promised info about Operation Phoenix survivors.[-].
Hm.. he promised that? Really?  [-] [-]Savior or not. [-] I think that's a bit too much to ask for classified information in our .. [-] juvenile acquaintance, don't you think? [-]Beyond that, it is not on me to give you that info, [-] but maybe you can try to convince me that I can trust you and I will see what I can do. [-] How does this sound?.
Very nice. [-] Listen: [-] I was in contact with a Talon named Kaydan. Not here. On a remote planet ..  [-] which was used by your people as well as far as I know. [-] We are both searching for some Technical Artifacts that are hidden in old burial chambers. [-] He found some on that planet already. [-] And here comes the problem: I am saying 'was used' because the Zirax have attacked that site and I am not sure if Kaydan and the others made it out there alive. [-] For now those artifacts he found are out of reach .. [-] and I am afraid we cannot wait until we are possibly able to meet again. [-] Things are heating up and time is running fast. [-] Luckily there is a burial chamber on this planet nearby the Sanctuary. [-] It is similar to the one on the training planet. [-] Of course we cannot simply go there. [-] This would for sure arouse the Zirax troops. [-] They are already looking at our activities with some suspicion. [-] So here is the deal: Go to that [-]burial chamber[-] and bring me the [-]Technical Artifacts[-]. [-] Then we'll talk again..
Hey my friend! [-] [-]So you managed to find something?.
[-]Tell about observations[-].
Hm.. [-] Seems like someone else was after these artifacts as well. [-] But why did they leave them behind? [-]Does not make sense for me. [-] Did you find any human remains? [-] Anything left behind?.
Booze and a diamond ring.
Oh..! Wait. [-] [-]That ring you found is not only a ring .. [-] when I am not mistaken it belongs to a member of the Abyssal family....
Yes. [-] Interesting, isn't it? [-] What were they doing here? As you know, the Abyssal are an influential house of the Zirax Empire. [-] The current Empress of the Empire is one of theirs. [-] They are usually not seen so far away from the Zirax homeworlds. [-] Maybe someone stole that ring .. and lost it again down in the tomb.. [-] Hm.. maybe.. [-] Not sure what the Xenu, Ghyst, Rados, Serdu and Epsilon are currently up to. [-] You leave their territory for a minute and next time you knock on their door, someone else is in charge. [-] Last time I talked to my contacts, there seemed to be something going on behind the curtain.. [-] Something big..
Not sure if I should share that .. [-] but you have proven twice that you can be trusted .. [-] at least a bit. [-]So .. [-] I heard some rumors that.. hm.. lets say: [-] things are getting more complicated for the Empress. [-] Rumors about a riot, a revolt behind the scenes and more serious things threatening the Empire. [-] And given there were Abyssal or maybe someone unknown but possibly related to the Zirax in that tomb searching for the artifacts, this menace does not seem to be the Kriel that have started to challenge the Zirax....
Hm.. [-] you already heard about that particular rumor, as it seems. [-] I hope this stays a rumor, otherwise we would be in real big trouble, in case those Talon elders are right and their frightening bed time stories become true.. [-]Actually [-] .. I do not know what's going on. [-] But I will report that to my contact person that an insignia of the House of Abyssal was found in this system..
What about the survivors of Operation Phoenix?.
Go[-] visit the orbital trading station[-] when you are done with whatever job brought you to this planet. [-] Get yourself a [-]Root Beer[-], sit down at the [-]Sky Guys bar[-] and enjoy the view. [-]I'll report to my organization and see what I can do for you. [-] You have already convinced me and I will now try to convince my supervisors to help you. [-] Won't take long, I hope. [-] Last, but not least, because you helped me and rescued doctor Mandor, I will[-] gift you one of our base teleporters[-]. [-]Place it onto your own base, but make sure you have enough generators to run it, so they do not explode. [-]  It will link itself to the Sanctuary and you can come here without having to walk or drive. [-] Ah.. before I forget .. [-] not sure if it might be of any help, but I have located a shot down Small Vessel of the Operation Phoenix fleet just nearby the Zirax Garrison on this planet: [-] You can [-]use the secret teleporter[-] behind these crates. It will bring you to a hidden observation site. From there you should be able to find the small vessel with a detector. [-] Prepare for Zirax patrols. [-]Hope to speak to you soon again. [-] Good luck!.
Activating the teleporter requires a RED KEYCARD.[-]In case of an emergency, contact Cmd. Carver on COMMAND level for approval..
Hello my friend! [-] Where are you speaking from? [-] Seems to be a party going on and I am not invited? [-] [-]  [-]Enjoy, but don't rest too long. [-] I have word from my organisation. [-] Due to your excellent performance in this mission,  helping TOP to regain that beer recipe, they have chosen to give you more info on the matter of Operation Phoenix..
Glad to hear, but the mission felt like a test being set up for me...
Ha. Gotcha! [-] But I hope you won't mind. [-] Bear with us. [-] We need to make sure the one we trust is not an impostor and up to the challenges the organization might throw at him. [-]Anyways. [-] In case you want to know more about the Operation Phoenix, go to the [-]SNOW planet [-]in this system. [-] There you will find the [-]wreckage [-]of the [-]UCH TITAN[-]. [-] It was shot down in the battle that followed the arrival of the so called 'Operation Phoenix' fleet..
Absolutely not. [-] [-]The organization badly wants to [-]recover a few logs[-] that have been lost in that wreckage. [-] They seem to be extremely important or contain information that are valuable to the founders of the organization. [-] [-]I sent the access codes for the console to your IDA with this transmission already. [-] But be warned! [-] [-]When going to the SNOW planet, you need at least a small vessel with a warp drive. [-] And better add some weapons and turrets on it. [-] The Zirax have quite some presence on that icy rock and they will not allow anyone to come close to that wreckage at all. [-] So better be prepared. [-] [-]Good luck!.
Thanks a lot. It'll be OK..
You may leave your cage now. Good luck!.
Hello Sir! [-]Do you have something for me? [-] Some [-]reports[-] maybe?.
...will be back in a minute!.
Excuse me, Sir. [-] I am currently occupied with .. things..
[-] July 26, 2473[-] Vice Admiral Benner [-] Commander Mercer [-] [-] Sir! We can't wait any longer. [-] The unknown enemy is amassing more and more ships. [-] We've already lost two transports and the TITAN will not stand a chance. [-] Please, get to the shuttle! [-] [-] Mercer, this is not your command. [-] Get out of here [-] and take Yaden with you. [-] We still must investigate the anomaly we found when entering this system. [-] I will report to Admiral Perez on the GRAND. [-] [-] How shall we..? [-] [-] [-] [-] [-] [-] This is Admiral Benner! [-] All personnel, abandon ship! [-] I repeat. [-] ABANDON SHIP! [-] The TITAN is lost! [-] All personnel go to the rescue pods! [-] [-] The GRAND and the rest of the fleet will warp out any minute. I rep... [-] [-] THEIA! [-] Make contact to .. [-] ..  the GRAND. [-] [-] [-]Our transceiver is damaged. We can send only, Vice Admiral. [-] [-] Contact established! [-] [-] Perez.. listen .. [-] I don't have a lot of time left. [-] We are pulling the enemies away from you! [-] .. we have de..cted the an...old relict! [-] A planetary remnant! [-] The wavefront .. originates from there! [-] We need to .. stay away from .. [-] [-]..end of message..[-].
