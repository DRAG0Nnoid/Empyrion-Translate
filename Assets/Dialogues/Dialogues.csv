That's exactly my point! As you might know, my grandpa was the lead engineer on the Hyperion. @w2 He was not lost with the ship only for one simple reason: someone decided to reschedule his shift. @w2 I'm thankful for that, but my grandpa never managed to get rid of the stigma of 'the coward that was left behind'.\n@p9 <color=#ffffff>[L]</color> My dad moved to Mars with me after my grandpa's sudden death. @w2 I signed up for the fleet right after college, to show what our family is capable of. @w2 My dad said that Grandpa became crazy about this shit. @w2 Pretending the officials just want to silence everyone. @w2 Especially him personally, and the Hyperion Bereaved organization. @w2 All his stories of a 'planned accident.' @w2 The ship 'not being destroyed' and some 'threat' we are facing - all very dramatic.\n@p9 <color=#ffffff>[L]</color> And, to be honest, until the last 24h, I always thought this old poor man simply could not cope with what happened. @w2 When you showed up on board the Titan, I suddenly remembered one of my grandpa's stories, about some 'black suits' visiting the Hyperion a few days ahead of the mission.\n@w2 <color=#9c9c9c>[M]</color> Commander. Please...\n@w2 <color=#ffffff>[L]</color> I tell you what: \n@p9 <color=#ffffff>[L]</color> I've been working for this project for nearly eight years now, and in these last few months, I've looked at this project and I've done the math. @w2 In the last week, and in the last 24 h in particular, so many strange things have happened.@w2 The GRAND and the TITAN each have several squads of marines on board. I checked the manifests yesterday. @w2 We have stashed away tons and tons and tons of high caliber ammo. @w2 I am an engineer. I know what these formulas and materials are made for. @w2 This is not for asteroid defense. @w2  And now you are coming on board. @w2 And the first thing you do, is to mess around with the protocols I have been developing for the last five years.\n@p9 <color=#9c9c9c>[M]</color> The adjustments we've made are coming directly from Apollon labs. @w2 Dr Greyson and Dr. Dawson?\n@w2 <color=#ffffff>[L]</color> I know them. @w2 But I have also looked at the changes you made. @w2 These are risky. I am not sure what they should do exactly. @w2 They don't seem to have any function that improves the efficiency of the warp drives.\n@w2 <color=#9c9c9c>[M]</color> Rest assured, these have been approved by top specialists, everything is fine.\n@w2 <color=#ffffff>[L]</color> Rest assured, if something goes wrong .. @w2and someone is harmed .. @w2 and I discover that it was because of your changes .. @w2 nothing will be fine .. @w2 for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dialogue_e0g4u,Operation?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_wiKAc,"Yeah... kind of UCH special operations. @w4 Let me try to sum this up for you. @p9 After we escaped with our bare lives, there was a lot of discussion about what the fleet should do next. The two Admirals, my father and anyone with any relevant info, was either lost or dead. And when our voyage started, everything was chaotic as well.  @p9 After a few weeks it became clear that we won't go back to earth anytime soon. So there was a fierce dispute on how to proceed. Although we had found a secret hiding place, some of the commanders and captains, led by Commander Lamarr, Captain Zerogen and others spoke to Vice Admiral Perez about supporting the local independence movement to find some allies and first and foremost gather more info that way, without running into the Zirax Empire again.  @p9 But Perez did not want to risk anything until we had built up a solid base of operations in that sector. She was also much more favored to establish the plans for the 'Project Eden'. Finding a planet for us to live on - or for others that might follow us to Andromeda now or in the future. @p9 Anyways. As a result,  Commander Lamarr and the others left the fleet and started the GLaD @w4 I think, as things stand now, Perez is quite happy about that, because GLaD helped to lead the Zirax forces astray several times already. So, after misconceptions were ruled out on both sides, GLaD is now secretly working with the UCH fleet, nurturing the resistance movement of the Talon against the Zirax and trying to get hands on any info about our fate and what the hell is going on in this galaxy. @p9 A short while ago, we actively tried to get in touch with you. Was quite a problem, but then one of our Talon agents managed to get hold of you. He was the guy upgrading your suit with our communication protocol. At the same time the Ilmarinen entered the sector and we found a way to implant an agent to the polaris mining facility where the Staff of Guidance was found.  And then .. here we are I think.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

She did not trust him at all. And she was absolutely right. Her literally punching him into the face for all this bullshit he caused, it's a meme already.  Did not help us a lot .. but .. that's something she should explain to you in person.\n\nSo, what do you want to know, kid?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_SmSCq,Any new clues from the info I retrieved?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_OYmmm,"Ok, I am trying a brief summary: @w2 The Talon seem to have been refugees, fleeing from the Triangulum galaxy. Fleeing from something what we know as 'The Legacy'. Still no idea what that exactly is, but it seems to be able to infect, control and even convert biological beings and machines. Pentaxid, the fuel of our warp drives and many other things, seems to play a role. The Ilmarinen, which you visited lately, was captured this way, when the unlucky crew dug up a part of an infected pentaxid asteroid and brought it on board. Bad idea. That's all we know about the Legacy so far. @p9 On the Talon topic: Your latest information indicates, that after the Talon arrived in Andromeda, they fell back into barbary, but have made it back to space in a short amount of time. They found and raised the Zirax and because the Talon were more the brains than the muscles, the Zirax grew into the role of the latter. After some decades of peace, the War of Silence started when the Legacy managed to follow the Talon to Andromeda. @p9 We do not yet know how this happened and also not how the war actually ended, but as far as we can say, the outcome was that the Talon were nearly eradicated from Andromeda. Not by the Legacy, but by the Zirax. That's where we still do not have a lot of information why this turned out as it did. You finding that cryogenized Talon prisoner named Kar'han indicates that the Zirax turned against their century-long allies all of a sudden. @p9 What we also know is that The Legacy was defeated, but not destroyed when the War of Silence ended. And it seems as though that entity is coming back to live more and more. As you, and others, already found out first hand. @p9 Taking all that into account, there is one thing that does not make much sense at least to us: The Talon seem to still be technically capable of doing next-to-magical things, but those that are capable are hiding their knowledge even from their own tribes.  We have been working with them for nearly a year, but they still keep it a secret, why they do not use their abilities to their full extent. If you ask me, this is a bit suspicious. As if they are waiting for something.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_09iCi,Anything else?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_4uaqS,"Yes. Maybe one word about the strange stick you found: You probably should keep that Staff of Guidance either on you all the time or in a safe, but easy to reach place. @w4 I am afraid we do not know what this device actually is or will do. I asked one of our Talon contacts, but he suddenly vanished and never reported back. @w4\n\nJust a gut feeling, but have it ready, when you need it, I guess.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_CuGY4,Thanks Emmerson. Next drink is on me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dialogue_4KWKJ,"Commander, I am afraid I need to ask for your immediate help.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_Oquqm,Emmerson indicated something...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_08K88,"We have lost contact with one of our agents in the nearby Sigma Fulcrum station. @p9 That happens once and awhile, but this specific agent not only was about to retrieve some valuable data from the caverns of the asteroid the station is built into .. but .. let's say he is not the usual agent and I am afraid he was a bit too ambitious than he was skilled for the task .. and I was running out of options.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_44iS4,Sounds dramatic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_GaaOa,"I hope it is not, but if something happened to him, this is something I would never forgive myself. @w4  His name is Yarod.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_Gqa7C,"Ok, I am listening.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_8e9au,"First things first: Yarod is a scientist who was running the exotic materials lab when the station was still under Polaris control. He had some disagreements with the management of the station, which is said to have led to the station being abandoned and later being captured by Pirates. The role of the station was never fully revealed, and, more astonishing, the Polaris did not even make any attempt to regain control. That's about 10 years ago. @p9 Today the station is known as the Sigma Fulcrum, run by a civil management and reportedly used by the Salurian clan as a main base of operations. Salurians are not the run of themill Pirates. They are in fact high tech hackers, counterfeiters, hijackers, traffickers, smugglers, forgers and run successful business operations on the sectors they operate on. @p9 In the last months, the station also became a source of a new drug: Trilinithane.  We would have taken Tril, as they call it, as just another drug. \n\nBut then, Yarod came into play. @p9 He contacted one of our local agents, pretending that the drug contains substances that cannot be found in this part of the galaxy. Maybe not even in Andromeda. That caught our interest. As the local agent was killed in what they say was an accident, Yarod volunteered to find out more. He said the source is somewhere down in the <color=#ffff00>machine hall level</color> of the asteroid  - in the belly of Sigma Fulcrum. @p9 Just before you arrived, we got an emergency message from the station, calling for help. Signed by Yarod. @w2 \nIt would be extremely important to get him out of there and take any valuable information with you. @w2\n\nThe station might officially be labeled 'under a civil management', but <color=#ffffff>expect anyone with a weapon trying to kill you</color> as we do not know if this mission might already be compromised. @w2 \nPrepare for being attacked out of nowhere, but try not create too much havoc please.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dialogue_8Oi4u,Glad you are here! The Salurian are after me. The station AI is trying to find and kill me as well. We need to do what needs to be done and then quickly get out of here.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_WKekK,Wait. You are a cyborg? We thought...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_8WqG2,"That's only half the truth. To be honest I have been the AI of this station, but managed to rescue myself from the VOID infection.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_0urqV,Wait. What?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_SCOOK,"I am not sure we have the time for lengthy explanations, but the GLaD can always send new agents I think? @w4 Well, I'll try to sum it up. @p9 Ten years ago a Zirax science team found a technical artefact in a remote excavation site at the edge of their territory. The Salurian clan seems to have stolen the artifact and sold it to Polaris right away. That's at least what the company manager typed in the log. The company brought the artifact to this station for being examined in the exotic materials lab. We have put it in an extremely strong containment field, but that was not enough I think. I alarmed the company, but they did not want to listen. @w4 As always. @p9 Long story short, the artifact started to aggressively capture my AI core and turned the station's internal defenses against the crew. I could not do anything. The company lost two destroyers in the evacuation.  @p9 A brave scientist named Yarod Halden downloaded my routines to a cyborg for being evacuated, but he did not survive and I was left behind. The station core was bombarded with EMP. I survived because he had shut me down before the attack started. @p9 As far as I can say I was reactivated five years after this incident by a caretaker looking for a helper cyborg. The station was reactivated and officially run by some civil management, while the real power was held by the Salurian using this station for their criminal endeavors. @p9 A few months ago, the engineering cyborgs of the station suddenly started to build new machines. I noticed some of the Salurian were concerned. Talking about an artifact found in the caverns which allowed them to create a new drug that had interesting effects on the consumers. Strength, speed, spatial awareness increased .. and a sudden death in case of the dose only being slightly too high. @p9 I started to investigate what happened. As it seems the artifact is - or was - a fragment of a larger entity found ten years ago by the Zirax archaeologists. They call it 'Essence of the VOID'. I found out that the Salurian did not intend to create that drug - the station itself started to produce it, after the Salurian experimented with the fragment. So the past events are about to repeat themselves. But this time, we have a chance to stop it before it kills all civilians on board.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_CRm0C,Does not sound as if it is an easy plan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_iG8eK,"Oh it is! @w4 We just need to upload my AI routines to the station so I can overwrite the root commands. Then we need to overload the infected processors and destroy the artifact and the station core. And because the station knows who I am, we need to give her proof that I am no danger anymore. That's one reason why I requested help from GLaD because if I just self destruct the station will not buy that. @p9 I checked your suit and ashtonignly it should be capable of carrying me without damaging it. Seems it was laid out for doing things like that? @w5 Ok, not time for chatter. <color=#ffff00>Destroy my temporary corpus now</color>. Your Suit AI has already integrated my backup. Then bring us as close as possible to one of the <color=#ffff00>stations access points</color> and then I'll take it from there. Ready?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dialogue_KuKaS,"Ok, that is worse than expected.  We need to stop that station asap or this part of the galaxy will be lost in a few days...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_u87q4,"Details please, Yarod!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_K0SW8,"As I already told the GLaD command, the station is producing a fluid of unknown properties. I have found several specimens of that material when I investigated what the pirates are doing here. This material does not exist in any world of this part of the galaxy. Neither the Zirax, nor the Kriel or any other faction uses this. The production plans indicate it is kind of a very advanced type of nanofluid enriched with nanobots. I doubt any of the known civilizations would be able to produce it .. although ...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_mmemm,Although .. what?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_uK4eW,Yarod .. please!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_gMaCS,"There is a rumor of a race of machines, called the TESCH.  They are said to reside somewhere towards the center of the galaxy. They were never seen in that sector of the galaxy and none of the known factions seem to have had any contact for hundreds of years.  Possibly a hoax. Such an advanced civilization would not have slipped off the radar .. except it was their absolute intention. @p9 Hm. When we make it out alive, we should try to convince the GLaD command to send an expedition force to the Excavation site where that 'Essence of the VOID' fragment was found. I managed to secure the coordinates at least. @p9 But for now - the deletion programs I injected into the remote processors have not been detected. Seems like a different section of the artifact was infecting the AI this time. It is far less aggressive and less well protected. Maybe it was the production command core. Anyways. Let's save the sector for all you biological beings, shall we?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_aWOW0,So .. what's the plan?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_aSaiO,Yarod,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_C0eSe,"Commander, before you reveal my existence to the GLaD .. may I ask you to not do that and keep it kind of our secret?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_CSSYe,"You are asking a lot, my friend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_aCqGu,"I know, but IDA told me you both had some concerns about the GLaD as well. And after all what happened to me, you might understand that I am not sure if I want to reveal myself to any organisation right now. What do you think?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_mCWCe,Sure. I will find an excuse why you are not with me.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_SquaA,"Thanks Commander.\n\nI will now send the data to the station and go into hibernation mode. \n\nIDA has offered me a high level security protected area in her core extension. I am absolutely amazed about her abilities! This will protect me from being discovered by accident. I will go into hibernation mode in addition, but I still can assist you in case you need me. IDA will reactivate me, if needed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_CDuGu,Yeah .. seems she is full of surprises.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_SWCaA,Hope this works. Off we go.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_emi4C,"The easiest way to reset the station AI is to convince it of a required maintenance. Use the various <color=#00ffff>station consoles</color> and read what the station AI is saying.

dialogue_SmSuu,Yarod,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_KWO8C,"Commander, IDA and I have tried to evaluate the data we have retrieved in Sigma Fulcrum to find out where the initial VOID artifact came from. We might have found a trace to an excavation site only a few solar systems away .. in Zirax space.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_K4mSm,That could make things complicated..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_e4W8a,"Yes. By a lot, I am afraid. We would need to find a way to sneak into the area, find the excavation site and closely examine any artifact or fragment we find there. This might allow us to find a better solution to end the thread coming from this Essence of the VOID, the danger it poses to any digital being and the drug derived from it. The galaxy is big and the Salurian and others will try to do the same as in Sigma Fulcrum over and over again. I cannot allow that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_aeaO0,You are not sounding like a typical AI when you say that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_Cg8jG,Hm. IDA mentioned this as well. Possibly the VOID artifact I got in touch with has had a lot more impact on my .. personality. I hope that's nothing you worry about?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dialogue_Om0Oe,Sounds like my everyday business,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_4M0ie,Why do you think so?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_OmqCe,"We got a message from an unknown source. To be precise: we know where the message came from, but not who has sent it. The message contains an audio sample with the clearly identifiable voices of Commander Lamarr and  Captain Zerogen.  It sounds like a sample made in  an interrogation. And the other voices are clearly Zirax. The analysts say, they might be held captive in a Ghyst facility .. which makes it utmost important we try everything to free them. Otherwise I fear the worst... @p9 There is one problem, though. We currently have no agents in that solar system and our data does not indicate any Ghyst activity in that sector as well. So probably it is a trap of some kind. But I am afraid we have no other choice. I think you will want to take on that by yourself?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_mOque,I am basically out of the door already ..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_K8Yat,"Thought so.  I have updated your galaxy map. The system is only a few dozen lightyears from our current position in a direct line and only a few clicks into the Zirax territory. Look for a solar system with the marker '<color=#ffff00>Mining Operation</color>'. Find the <color=#ffff00>asteroid field</color> and enter it with maximum caution. This is a border world, but there might be some Zirax presence, mainly combat units of the Xenu. So be careful. @p9 There is one thing to note, though. The mysterious sender has amended one word to the file:<color=#ffff00> Staff of Guidance</color>.  Better you take that with you .. whatever that means. Good Luck, Commander. Bring them back - whatever it takes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_eCGUc,I'll bring them back .. alive!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_uEOKe,"Probably, yes. But this time you are kind of affected personally.  You remember that mission Commander Lamarr is currently away with? It was a quite delicate mission and not hearing back from her for a longer time usually is nothing to worry about. They are still in the scheduled time frame. @w4\n\nBut I think they got caught by the Zirax.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_uKSje,Ambassador Hyzani,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_eksmq,Welcome Commander {PlayerName}! I am honored by your attendance. I have been following your progress for quite a while.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_qCSCG,Ah.. so usually you guys tend to shoot at me without any kind words,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_K4OmC,"Well, that's why we are meeting here on that fully automated vessel - and not anywhere else. We have a lot of things to talk about. And no worries, no one knows I am here.

dialogue_ik8Cm,Maybe with this message you sent...are the captives here? What do you want from me?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_iWauq,"No, they are not here. Your analysts might have found out already that they are held captive in a Ghyst facility. My spies have sent me that voice sample and I took the chance to get in touch with GLaD. I have hoped you would come personally - and I was lucky. I would like to help you get back your comrades, but this is a bit difficult for me as well, as this is nothing I can be linked with officially. Things in the Empire are a bit.. complicated at the moment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_aaGUa,So what's the deal?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_UWOIq,"Right on the spot. As always. That's why I hoped you would come - and because there was a chance you won't blast this ship to pieces after you notice its insignia. @w4 While we speak my agents are preparing more information about the Ghyst prison. In the meantime, I would like to ask you to help me with a few things in return..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_Soe8G,Why should I do that?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_SuaaW,"Because you will not only rescue your friends, but possibly also learn a lot about the past of the Zirax, the Talon and the Legacy. Information your friends from GLaD and the UCH fleet will not get hands on in a million years. Or aren't you interested in that?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_acqCm,"Great, so we have a deal. First thing I need to say is that whatever you will do for me, this will probably not increase your reputation with the Zirax Empire or their houses. Especially not with the Xenu and the Ghyst. I'll explain that to you later, if you want to know more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_GGuWO,"So you cannot be linked to anything that will happen, correct?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_kCuuc,"Correct. At least not yet.  @w4 So, first thing I would like you to do is to bring me some of the <color=#00ffff>Technical Artifacts</color> found down on the temperate planet in this system. There is an <color=#ffff00>excavation site</color> with possibly some Xenu forces around. Eliminate the forces if you need to, but more important, go down in the caverns and bring me the artifacts. Feel free to take what you need for that mission from my ship.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dialogue_mGSB4,Ambassador Hyzani,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_0Ku80,Oh - you are already back. Any problems so far?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_eCWu0,Not really. So what did I just bring you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_mSSqG,"Well, that's indeed interesting. What do you know about the TESCH and the VOID?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_8aC4m,Just the names - and some rumors.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_mSaa4,"Ok, so a little history lesson in a brief summary: the TESCH are a civilization of AIs. They reside in a quite large territory more towards the center of the galaxy. The VOID are being found in the same region - although they do not seem to be.. active? The TESCH, on the other hand, are a living civilization, but they do not aim for any contact with us biological beings and no one has ever tried to get in touch with them for at least a few hundred years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_OKCGi,"Except your people, I assume?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_0mae4,"No, not even the Zirax Empire has had any real contact with them. Two or three centuries ago, there was a convoy heading for the center of the galaxy. The commander ran out of resources and they scavenged a field of debris. At least that's what the reports say, but it is more likely they unintentionally destroyed a TESCH collective in the process. As a result, the convoy was nearly fully eradicated and the remains were sent in a giant capsule to the Zirax Empire. @p9 The House of Xenu and the Ghyst insisted on seeking revenge. Her majesty, the empress, was not willing to approve, so the Xenu and Ghyst ministers just used their powers and sent the fleets. None of them ever returned. After the ministers were removed from their positions her majesty and the loyalists forced a bill to not further provoke any military action from or with the TESCH.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_m9l84,Sounds like a wise choice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_WcM0W,"It was. But the Xenu and the Ghyst did not forget about that defeat. Since then they use every chance they have to increase their standing in the Empire. The conflict with the Kriel .. it is a result of their rage as well. But I digress. Back to the TESCH. @p9 It is said that the TESCH or their ancestors once ruled the whole galaxy. Which I think might be correct as remains of an ancient civilization, which vanished thousands of years ago, are still to be found everywhere. These are often also called the 'Progenitors'.   While I did my research about the LEGACY a few years ago, I also found a lot of evidence that the Progenitor seem to share some similarities with the LEGACY. At least to some extent, and although they might have never met. But I do not have any proof and this is not a very popular topic in the Imperial Academy for obvious reasons.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_SOi8K,"So, but what about the Essence of the VOID?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_OiWiu,"To be honest - I do not have any idea. It seems to be related to the TESCH to some extent. As I said, the VOID are reportedly found in the territory of the TESCH, but they seem to just be monolithic, black rocks. That's why I wanted you to bring me those artifacts. I will analyze them and in case I get new evidence, I would be honored to solve that riddle with your help as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_44CKe,Speaking of help - so what about my friends?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_4hlOq,"I am currently waiting for confirmation of their location. Should not take long anymore. Until then, in case you are interested to learn more about the Zirax history, the Talon-Zirax Assembly and the War of Silence, I probably have something for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_KK2um,War of Silence?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_00qOw,Oh I see these terms are already familiar to you. Great. Then I would suggest visiting the old Abyssal archive and speak to its keeper.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_OgCWK,"I sense this is not just walking in a clean museum, correct?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_OoaOO,"I am afraid, no. This particular archive was found only a year ago and is now under control of the Xenu. They did not manage to enter it, but I assume with the things currently escalating, they will just blast it to pieces. That's something I want to avoid at all cost.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_uKeuS,That's where I come into play?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_Otm08,"I hope so. The archive is hidden in an asteroid <color=#ffff00>in the orbit of the Desert Burnt world in this sector.</color> The asteroid was once part of a planet that got destroyed in the late phase of the War of Silence. I heard you already found its counterpart: the archive of the Talon Academy of Science. You also found the Staff of Guidance. You should bring the staff with you when speaking to the Keeper.  He will probably recognize that insignia of the Talon-Zirax Assembly and will answer all of your questions. @p9 Important for me and all of us is that you find a way to extract the knowledge that is kept there, before the Xenu manage to destroy it. The Keeper will help you with that when you show him the staff and this <color=#ffff00>Seal of the House of the Abyssal</color>.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_eOK8O,Sounds doable.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dialogue_SO4Ci,Welcome visitor  to the Imperial Archives of the glorious House of Abyssal.\nHow may I serve you?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_aiu4m,So you must be the Keeper of these Archives?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_C4WWq,"I am afraid there is no info available in these archives, your excellency. Other archives might hold information about them, but I am currently suffering from a long standing .. disconnection .. from the imperial archive network ..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_a4WCq,Never mind then. Can you tell me something about the LEGACY instead?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_04aKe,"Of course, your excellency! @w4 The term LEGACY is used to describe an entity that is capable of infecting biological beings and transforming them into an infected, yet intelligent version. The so called Infected do not suffer from hunger, heat or cold, can breathe or live in the vacuum of space or in extremely radiated places. The first contact with Infected has been recorded just ahead of the War of Silence, which started 1300 years ago.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_0GueC,What actually IS the LEGACY?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_4qmOi,"Scientific reports made during the War of Silence indicate that the LEGACY is a semi-material entity, bound to some structures in the real world. Usually these structures were holding a certain amount of Pentaxid element before they were converted to some radioactive alien metal (no data available). The LEGACY itself is not the sum of all the transformed biological beings under its control - not like a bee hive - but the sum of the energy it stole from them. @p9 The exact method of this stealing process has not been found, but the investigations indicate that an infecting particle is somehow transferring the energetic spirit of any higher life form to a local pool of the entity. The local pools aggregate into 'Hive Nuclei'. When a Nucleus is strong enough, a local entity, referred to as 'hive mind' is created. This hive mind then tries to get in touch with other hive minds on nearby Nexus worlds. It also sends out ships that seed the 'Legacy particles' on new worlds.@p9 It was found that the Legacy particle can only infect higher beings, but not animals or lower lifeforms. The particle does actually infect lower lifeforms, but dies without gaining control or being able to transform them. The controlling of infected higher lifeforms is a side effect, though. They are used as cannon fodder for the LEGACY. The hives are not weakened by killing these Infected. It only slows down the spread of the Legacy Particle. This knowledge was used by the Ghyst and the Xenu for the Infinite Life Forms (ILF) weapon (created by the Serdu), - after the destruction of several planets with conventional weapons did not succeed. @p9 The ILF was deployed on many worlds, creating a myriad of unintelligent, lower lifeforms. The theory was that the LEGACY could be 'dried out' or at least distracted, while spending more and more effort to compensate for the loss of its Legacy Particles, while conventional weapons destroy their hives. This strategy seems to have been successful as the Legacy was pushed back to the edge of the galaxy. The War of Silence officially ended 900 years ago.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_CuCWa,Is there evidence that the LEGACY was destroyed?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_qO8Ou,"I am afraid this information was removed from the archives, your excellency. The information is not available.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_uaDae,Interesting. Can you tell me something about the Zirax Empire?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_SsKS8,"The glorious Zirax Empire was founded about 800 years ago, after the treachery of the Talon led to a civil war. The Talon-Zirax assembly was dissolved as a result and the Zirax Empire was born. It was founded by the most influential houses of the Zirax: The Xenu, the Ghyst, Rados, Epsilon, Serdu and Abyssal. The first empress was a member of the house of Serdu. In the beginning, this changed with nearly each new royal election. The last two centuries, the empress has always been a member of the House of Abyssal, though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_emC8K,Hm .. can you tell me more about the Talon treachery?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_GiWso,"Even before the War of Silence, the Zirax houses did all the dirty work for the Talon-Zirax assembly. When the War of Silence came to its end, evidence was found by the Xenu  that the Talon might have initiated the war intentionally to weaken the houses and overtake the rulership. Ghyst specialists found out that the Talon were using similar tech than the ships of the LEGACY and that they seem to have come from the same spot outside of this galaxy. The high court of the houses decided that, after the dust of war settled down, to disempower these traitors for the good of all biological beings. @p9 Most of the Talon did not escape their deserved punishment and were enslaved or sent to reservations. There have been reports of a refugee fleet having fled into deep space. The glorious Zirax Empire is well aware about that and always ready to withstand their attack - or anyone else's.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_OKwGW,"Ok, I think I have heard enough. Is there a possibility to download that archive?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dialogue_q4uXi,Ambassador Hyzani,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_Ku0KM,Glad you made it out alive. I heard the Xenu have destroyed the archive. I'll make sure they get their payback for that.\nDid you find what you were searching for?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_GqKte,"Yes, but there are a few things that do not fit. The Talon being traitors?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_KQWa8,"Yeah, I expected that you would find this questionable. But you need to know, the archive was created by my ancestors and only with the view of the glorious Empire in mind.  Let me fill in some blanks and clarify a few details. @p9 The 'evidence' the Xenu and the Ghyst found about the Talon having set up the War of Silence was already heavily disputed at that time. The specialist of the House of Abyssal later found out, that the evidence was made up, faked or only half the truth. BUT, at this point no one did care, because the Houses have decided to take over the control. So they just used this reason - and everyone won. Except the Talon. A lot of the members of the Academy of Sciences were killed or imprisoned. But also a lot of the Talon, at least more than the Empire will admit, have fled into deep space. But never returned. @p9 One thing of the evidence found back then seems to be correct: the Talon did use a similar tech than the LEGACY ships. Even the shapes of the ships were nearly identical. Also the weapons. And they came from a distant galaxy, Triangulum as you call it, as refugees as we found out. So there actually IS a connection between the Talon and the LEGACY. We just haven't found out what it is. I am feeling, we are so close...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_4O8Oi,"Don't want to hold you off from anything, but I have a pressing mission...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_XamSW,"Of course. And we will start with this right now! As promised, my spies have located the prison complex. It is located in @w4 .. hold on a second. @w2 We are getting an emergency report!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_q2OWA,I have a bad feeling..,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_4mmi0,"Commander, seems like your GLaD organization has a traitor in its crew. I just received a message that a small GHYST task force will depart in a few hours towards the GLaD outpost .. with the order to destroy everything. No prisoners. You should head back asap, find that traitor and get rid of that problem. Otherwise our operation to free your comrades might end before we even started...  I will be here and see what I can prepare until then. Good Luck, my friend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_G0eC0,Damn.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_O0WG0,Of course I am!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_uEWaW,"Yes, indeed. I am the humble Keeper of the Archives of the glorious House of Abyssal. @w4 And although you do not seem to be of my creator's kind, you are the honorable Keeper of the Staff of Guidance .. @w4 and you also hold a seal of the House of Abyssal! \n\nPlease forgive me my inexcusable ignorance, your excellency.

dialogue_80OuW,Didn't you say we need to get hold of the traitor at first?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_OKav4,I think that you interfered with their plans enough so they will be distracted a while. This is where we can start our own operation.\n\nI assume you found a Ghyst command card when defeating the Ghyst troops?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dialogue_4OGoC,"Perfect. That will make things a lot easier, because no one will deactivate that card for the near future. The communication ways are long in the Empire.

dialogue_iiGOG,Mercer!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_OiqWG,"No, Mercer is most likely dead. And his son .. no way. He did not even know what we were up to. It is someone else. Either working with or even from inside the UCH. Someone who seems to have gained a lot of influence in the last months. We had some company yesterday. They sedated us, but I heard they were speaking about us. And one of them was a terran. Without doubt. We will find that traitor. I now know his voice!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_eGGKU,"Ok, so first of all, we need to get you and Jennifer out of here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_aKeOc,Wait! We cannot go alone. You will never believe who came in last week. A Talon! But not one of those tribal guys you have possibly met. This one is wearing a tech suit and looks different. We need to free him as well! They brought him into the security cell over there! His name is Tharkan.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

dialogue_Ouuue,Before the Ghyst are finding out what we do here .. may I ask a question?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_u4iWK,"Sure, my friend.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_8YWqK,The suit you are wearing indicates you are not from this part of the galaxy .. or a Talon?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
dialogue_aaSSi,"I see you are not new to some of the secrets of this galaxy. So, for now, I am actually a Talon. And I think saying that, you have already drawn an interesting conclusion of where I am coming from. I hope you will consider taking me with you so we can share some information.
